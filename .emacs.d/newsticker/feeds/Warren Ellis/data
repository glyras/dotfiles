Which is probably just as well, as <a href=\"http://twitter.com/warrenellis\" target=\"_blank\" >I talk a lot of shit on Twitter</a>. It&rsquo;s basically mental slurry, the wet lumpy bits from a day spent at the keyboard vented off into a trap so the buildup doesn&rsquo;t blow some crucial valve in my head. Look at these, from the last few months: </p><p>* If I can just fit my head inside this pig&rsquo;s arse, my David Cameron halloween costume will be complete </p><p>* I&rsquo;ve run out of Red Bull. MOVE TO COMS CHANNEL S ACTIVATE RESTON5 </p><p>* busy gluing baby doll heads on to a lurex thong #halloweencostumes </p><p>* Damn. I&rsquo;m gonna have to write another comic for Marvel now, just to try and out-crazy @BRIANMBENDIS &rsquo;s MOON KNIGHT. </p><p>* Send warm bodies. I must leech their essence to survive this new ice age. </p><p>* Buying the RED graphic novel is scientifically proven to make you more attractive to any and all mammals. And some fish. </p><p>* Am carefully coughing on all the tables in the pub. Fuck these people, with their health and snot-free heads. </p><p>* I&rsquo;d like to write a Kindle Single next year, I think. </p><p>* @cully_hamner Fuck you. Toronto made it snow inside my testicles and you got a bit warm in lovely New Orleans. SNOW INSIDE MY TESTICLES </p><p>* It is so cold, rainy and vile out here that it could still be summer. </p><p>* Ed Miliband made Labour Party leader. Britain sinks deeper into its sofa, heartbeat slowing with raw excitement. </p><p>* I could quite fancy being a Baron. There&rsquo;s a Baron Strange, you know. Suave. </p><p>* His full title is the Baron Strange of Knockin. Marginally less suave. </p><p>* Huh. I was nominated for a British Fantasy Award. This means I am one of the more fantasised-about people in Britain. </p><p>* Remember: if you ever watch an edition of X Factor, Satan gives Simon Cowell another ten years of life. </p><p>* Okay, who thought it was a good idea to have the Pope meet schoolboys on his Scottish visit? He has a white van, guys. </p><p>* I bet that with a just little biohacking, heroin could go from scary drug to low-carb superfood in no time </p><p>* Soaking brain in pool of whisky to see what blackened ideas float to the surface. No paddling. </p><p>* On September 11, 1940, George Stibitz operated the first computing machine ever used remotely over a phone line. </p><p>* I like to believe that he transmitted an ASCII image of a cat watching you wank. </p><p>* When my daughter is bad, I force her to watch &quot;Jozin Z Bazin&quot; as punishment. Am I infringing her human rights? </p><p>* I was hoping for a whole series of MACHETE films. MACHETE FOREVER. DRIVING MACHETE. ALL THAT MACHETE. CITIZEN MACHETE. </p><p>* Also THE FIRST MACHETE CLUB and THERE WILL BE MACHETE. </p><p>* Daughter snarkily amazed that I cooked a stirfry and didn&rsquo;t kill her. In retrospect, and for different reasons, so am I. </p><p>* Neil Gaiman told me to be merciful to the weak &amp; fearful. A prize to the first reader to mercy-kill and skin one of them for me. </p><p>* my brain is awake but i think my body died. dragging self to pub using only prehensile frontal lobe. could take a while. </p>

The BBC operates this section called something like BBC Hostiles &#8212; threat analysis and security for BBC employees in hotzones, red-line communications between the field and head office.</p><p>So Lenny Henry gave me a disgusting disease by forcing a committed man-hug upon me.

And on top of that, one of the girls&rsquo; rats has to go to the vet tomorrow morning for an operation to remove a tumour.  (Which is a minor thing: rats are prone to tumours, and this one is small and mobile, they can just snip it out.)  The name of the rat in question?  Lenny.  Wasn&rsquo;t my idea, Lili named them.

Tomorrow and for the rest of the week, it&rsquo;s back to finishing off outstanding comics jobs for various places.  But today, because I&rsquo;m feeling a bit better, I&rsquo;m letting myself do the fun stuff: thinking of new things.</p>
