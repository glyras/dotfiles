perl-archive-zip: added v1.31_01 - a perl module for manipulating zip files
libreoffice: added v3.2.99.2_20101010 - this is the built-from-source version
  of LibreOffice 3.3-beta2.  LibreOffice is the continuation (or 'fork' if you
  want) of OpenOffice.org which has been abandoned by its developers after
  Oracle got its hands on it.  It is essentially the continuation of another
  'fork' called go-oo.  Having built this from source on Slackware, I think it
  is a lot faster than the pre-built binaries you can download from the
  http://www.documentfoundation.org/ site.  Give me feedback please!
  Big WARNING:
  The source code of LibreOffice is very much in flux - the only way to build
  this is using git snapshots.  The SlackBuild may produce a working package
  one day and fail miserably the other.  I have uploaded a version that
  obviously compiled :-)  If you want to reproduce the build...  it takes
  many many hours to download and build.  A list of download URLs for all
  the components (tarballs from websites or checkouts from git) still needs
  to be added to the SlackBuild so that the build process can proceed offline.
  For now, the SlackBuild checks out everything on the spot.
  Building from source requires that you have these packages installed:
  apache-ant, perl-archive-zip and xulrunner.

used as the 'userspace' component of the Kernel Virtual Machine (or KVM) which
is available in Slackware's kernel as 'kvm' 'kvm-intel' and 'kvm-amd' modules.
KVM is \"a full virtualization solution for Linux on x86 hardware containing
virtualization extensions (Intel VT or AMD-V)\".
The qemu-kvm program will allow you to run a variety of Virtual Machines

near-native speeds for x86 and x86_64 guests.
Note: this package requires the vde package to be installed as well.
Furthermore, your user needs to be a member of the 'kvm' group in order to
get the benefit of hardware-supported virtualization.
