            <p>Greetings:</p>

<p>I am using Nagios to monitor a host. If the host looses connectivity, I want Nagios to execute an event handler.</p>

<p>The host definition contains a defined event_handler directive. The host inherits from generic-host and; therefore, event_handler_enabled is 1. In my main configuration file event handling is enabled. The associated command configuration file has also been defined.</p>

<p>While troubleshooting I tried the following as root:</p>

<h1>su nagios</h1>

<h1>./test-handler [and my args here of course]</h1>

<p>The output is correct as user nagios. However, the nagios binary that runs under user nagios will not execute the script. Here is a bit of my nagios.log file:</p>

<p>[1273208210] HOST ALERT: vXP;DOWN;SOFT;2;CRITICAL - Host Unreachable (192.168.0.21)
[1273208210] HOST EVENT HANDLER: vXP;(null);(null);(null);test-handler!$HOSTADDRESS$
[1273208212] EXTERNAL COMMAND: SCHEDULE_FORCED_HOST_CHECK;vXP;1273208211
[1273208220] HOST ALERT: vXP;UP;SOFT;3;PING OK - Packet loss = 0%, RTA = 35.37 ms
[1273208220] HOST EVENT HANDLER: vXP;(null);(null);(null);test-handler!$HOSTADDRESS$</p>

<p>According to the output, nagios appears to be running my command; however, based on the output it is actually doing nothing at all. I know that whatever I'm missing is probably very simple (and knowing me; it's right under my nose), but I'm at a loss.</p>

<p>Any takers?</p>

            <p>Hi,
I have started using the xeon for large intensive jobs.  However, only 1 core runs at 100percent.  The rest at ~20.  My software is for all 8cores.  The developer says it's a Linux issue.</p>

<p>On reading it appears Ubuntu isn't ready for 8cores by default and I need to rebuild the kernel.  This isn't a prob.  However, before starting will someone pls tell me is it ok to find the current ker. source and re configure rather than worry about supporting all necessary drivers in a new file?</p>

<p>Or, is there a better Linux distro for parallel use?  I used Gentoo for years so rebuilding is easy.  But will someone advise me on this since I don't want any mistakes with Ubuntu?</p>

<p>Thank you.
Gav.</p>

            <p>I use an embedded terminal (Tilda) full time on my desktop, as I connect to my network of Ubuntu machines mainly thru SSH. I set up an update notification script that tells me update staus remotely, but it's kind o' clunky (I know my scripting skills are far from pro). Here's what I set up: </p>

<p>Create a folder ~/.updates.<br>
Create script called updates as follows:  </p>

<pre><code>#!/bin/bash
# cat updates
# A script to print out update status in bash
#
sudo apt-get update &gt; ~/.updates/updates.log
sudo apt-get -s dist-upgrade &gt;&gt; ~/.updates/updates.log
cat ~/.updates/updates.log | grep upgraded,
</code></pre>

<p>This does the job, but I'm sure it's far from optimal. Anyone have any suggestions on how to get it tightened up? This sort of thing is easy to do in some distros (Arch comes to mind), but Ubuntu is designed more for things like Update Manager and other graphical tools, so this was the best I could come up with so far. I want to be able to just get the line for available updates (for use in other scripts), not all the associated printout.</p>

            <p>Hello. </p>

<p>Audio-streaming is becoming increasingly popular and there are several programs that can stream for example PCM-signals to a soundcard. </p>

<p>Now I have a CD-player with a really good DA-converter that can recieve and play digital PCM-signals from another DVD player through an optical or coaxial cable. </p>

<p>My question is: -How do I make the computer send the PCM-stream straight to the CD-players digital inlet? For instance through the USB outlet straight into a coaxial cable? </p>

<p>Is that possible, mabe some kind of handshake between the machines is needed? </p>

<p>I have been thrugh the SOX manuel papers without finding a solution. 
Is there a hacker out there that can enlight me on this subject? </p>

<p>The on the client side I use 2 ssh tunnels;</p>

<p>]# ssh -f -N -L 52051:localhost:2051 my.server</p>

<p>]# ssh -f -N -L 52049:localhost:2049 my.server</p>

<p>I can telnet to these ports and receive a response.
So now I try to mount;</p>

<p>]# mount -t nfs -o nolock,port=52049,mountport=52051 localhost:/home/Shared /mnt/Shared</p>

<p>mount.nfs: mount to NFS server 'localhost:/home/Shared' failed: RPC Error: Program not registered</p>

<p>So it <em>seems</em> as if the problem is caused by mount talking to the local portmap, however I thought the mount options were supposed to stop that. Obviously I cannot forward portmapper from the server to the client's port 111 as that would disrupt the client's portmapper.</p>

<p>I am using SUSE 11.2 for the client and Ubuntu 10.04 as the server.</p>

            <p>I use sshfs everyday and find it very useful.  One item I have not been able to figure out is when the mount takes place, the mount points show up as \"drives\" on my desktop.  I'm okay with that except for some of the mount points are not owned by my current login.  In other words, I have one mount point that is owned by \"root\" but it appears on my desktop.  I get permission denied when I try to access the drive but I'd prefer it not show up if I can't view it.  I use GNOME so I'm not sure if that makes a difference.  Any thoughts?</p>

            <p>Hi,
i think i got some probs with my iptables firewall, my setup is i got a pc (debian installed) with 2 ethernetcard, eth0 connected to my lan(192.168.1.0/24) eth1 for internet connection (ppp0)
I have an openvpn server on that pc in bridged mode, the vpn clients can connect but can't ping the server or any other pc on my lan and the server or my lan pcs can't ping the clients. The bridge is setup correctly and the setup of the openvpn server looks right and the clients got an ip from my lan and a route to it so routing looks fine, problem must be the iptables firewall. 
The requierements for the firewall are : 
my Lan can do anything except receiving or posting windows shares, netbios etc over the internet or vpn
the vpn clients can do anything except receiving or posting windows shares, netbios etc over the vpn and
they can not access the internet over the vpn.</p>

            <p>I am having a remarkable amount of trouble building gcc 4.5 on Linux (Red Hat Enterprise 4).  For good measure, I also tried on my mac running Leopard.</p>

<p>I would love to just install an rpm, but the Red hat version we are running is old enough that no one has rpms for it.  So I thought I would build off source, no problem, right?</p>

<p>First, /opt/tools was created for me, so I could write the results in there without being sysadmin</p>

<p>gcc 4.5 now requires three packages: GMP, MPFR, and MPC, all math primitives.</p>

<p>I successfully built all three wth:</p>

<p>./configure --prefix=/opt/tools
make
make install
(for GMP I also did make check)</p>

<p>For MPFR and MPC, configuration was slightly different:</p>

<p>./configure --prefix=/opt/tools --with-gmp=/opt/tools</p>

<p>So I have gmp-5.0.1, mpfr-3.0.0, mpc-0.8.2</p>

<p>gcc instructions are more complicated, because it bootstraps itself.
The compiler that I have on the system is 3.4.6.</p>

<p>In my directory with all the packages, I first create a directory to build into:
mkdir gcc451
cd gcc451
Then from inside the empty directory, I call configure in the gcc directory:</p>

<p>../gcc-4.5.1/configure --prefix=/opt/tools --with-gmp=/opt/tools --with-mpfr=/opt/tools --with-mpc=/opt/tools</p>

<p>On the mac, I also had to add target directives, I am a little hazy as to why, but something is messed up in the configuration evidently</p>

<p>--build=x86_64-apple-darwin10 --host=x86_64-apple-darwin10 --target=x86_64-apple-darwin10</p>

<p>On the mac, configure reports:
checking for the correct version of gmp.h... yes
checking for the correct version of mpfr.h... yes
checking for the correct version of mpc.h... yes
checking for the correct version of the gmp/mpfr/mpc libraries... no
configure: error: Building GCC requires GMP 4.2+, MPFR 2.3.1+ and MPC 0.8.0+.</p>

<p>I export DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH=/opt/lib
still, it doesn't find those libraries, but they are there:</p>

<p>libgmp.10.dylib libgmp.la   libmpc.dylib    libmpfr.a
libgmp.a    libmpc.2.dylib  libmpc.la   libmpfr.dylib
libgmp.dylib    libmpc.a    libmpfr.4.dylib libmpfr.la</p>

<p>On the Linux box, I somehow got it to recognize the libs in /opt/tools, and ./configure was successful.  I am not there now, but will append the details later at work.  However, after compiling, the code is unable to find libgmp, even though it's built, and
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/opt/tools/lib containing all three libraries.  So the problem is similar even though there, configure reports no problems.</p>

<p>I'm not surprised that there's a little difficulty on the Mac, but I was startled at how hard this was on Linux.  I remembered about the multi-pass build, but still there is no hardware dependency, no odd drivers to contend with....</p>

<p>Any help?</p>

            <p>Hi,
i think i got some probs with my iptables firewall, my setup is i got a pc (debian installed) with 2 ethernetcard, eth0 connected to my lan(192.168.1.0/24) eth1 for internet connection (ppp0)
I have an openvpn server on that pc in bridged mode, the vpn clients can connect but can't ping the server or any other pc on my lan and the server or my lan pcs can't ping the clients. The bridge is setup correctly and the setup of the openvpn server looks right and the clients got an ip from my lan and a route to it so routing looks fine, problem must be the iptables firewall. 
The requierements for the firewall are : 
my Lan can do anything except receiving or posting windows shares, netbios etc over the internet or vpn
the vpn clients can do anything except receiving or posting windows shares, netbios etc over the vpn and
they can not access the internet over the vpn.</p>

<p>Please if someone could have a look at my script?</p>

<p>Heres the interesting part of my firewall script:
