<p> A bolt of excitement ran through the field of cardiology in the early 1980s when <a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external-link\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.americanheart.org/presenter.jhtml?identifier=153\">anti-arrhythmia drugs</a> burst onto the scene. Researchers knew that heart-attack victims with steady heartbeats had the best odds of survival, so a medication that could tamp down irregularities seemed like a no-brainer. The drugs became the standard of care for heart-attack patients and were soon smoothing out heartbeats in intensive care wards across the United States.</p>
<p>But in the early 1990s, cardiologists realized that the drugs were also doing something else: killing about 56,000 heart-attack patients a year. Yes, hearts were beating more regularly on the drugs than off, but their owners were, on average, one-third as likely to pull through. Cardiologists had been so focused on immediately measurable arrhythmias that they had overlooked the longer-term but far more important variable of death.</p>
<p>The fundamental error here is summed up in an old joke scientists love to tell. Late at night, a police officer finds a drunk man crawling around on his hands and knees under a streetlight. The drunk man tells the officer he’s looking for his wallet. When the officer asks if he’s sure this is where he dropped the wallet, the man replies that he thinks he more likely dropped it across the street. Then why are you looking over here? the befuddled officer asks. Because the light’s better here, explains the drunk man.</p>
<p>That fellow is in good company. Many, and possibly most, scientists spend their careers looking for answers where the light is better rather than where the truth is more likely to lie. They don’t always have much choice. It is often extremely difficult or even impossible to cleanly measure what is really important, so scientists instead cleanly measure what they can, hoping it turns out to be relevant. After all, we expect scientists to quantify their observations precisely. As Lord Kelvin put it more than a century ago, “When you can measure what you are speaking about, and express it in numbers, you know something about it”...</p>

Flamingos (and many other birds) press their heads to the preen glands at the base of their tails to pick up feather-protecting oils, which they then spread around their bodies.</p><p>The researchers realized that those oils contain pigments, ranging from red to yellow, by keeping an eye on the flamingos&#8217; feathers and behavior: They noticed that the coloring of the birds was brightest during the mating season, and quickly diminished after they found a mate.

In honor of that, we&#8217;re discussing The Ethics of the Undead here at <strong>Science, Not Fiction</strong>. This is part II of IV. </em></p><p>Before we can start investigating whether or not something that craves brains has a mind or should be pitied, we need to define just what, exactly, we’re talking about when we talk about zombies.</p><p>I’m going to start by ruling out the <em>28 Days Later </em>zombies and the voodoo/demonic zombies of <em>Evil Dead</em>. First, the name of this blog is <strong>Science, not Fiction<em>, </em></strong>which means any religious hokum is right out the door. Demon possession, souls back from Hell, and voodoo are <em>not</em> going to be considered in this investigation. On the other end of the spectrum, in <em>28 Days Later</em> anything infected with “Rage” becomes a “fast” zombie. In essence, Rage is rabies only way, way scarier. Thus we aren’t dealing with the “undead” so much as the violently insane. So non-fatal pathogens don’t count either. If the pathogen doesn’t <em>first</em> kill you, then re-animate you, then you aren’t a zombie.</p><p>Which leads us to the next question: how does the pathogen work? I am not denying here the multitude of variations and nuances among zombie plague viruses, so we have to come up with a generic, realistic version to have our discussion. Zombies generally meet three important criteria. They are 1) stimulus-response creatures that seek flesh 2) continually decomposing and 3) contagious via bodily fluids. If we can explain, reasonably, how and for what reason a pathogen might cause/allow these conditions, we can describe a realistic zombie pathogen.</p><p><strong>Condition 1</strong>, that zombies are stimulus-response creatures that seek flesh, implies that the pathogen must act to re-animate the existing neural pathways and motor functions in some fashion. Let us presume human-only infection and that the virus, being species specific, results in a cannibalism preference. Thus the sensory systems which are re-activated are capable of distinguishing four key things: flesh-vs-not-flesh; species; infected-vs-uninfected; self. Furthermore, for the sake of simplicity, the virus does not <em>create</em> any new systems, it merely hijacks existing ones.</p><p>Next, we have to remember that contracting the zombie pathogen is terminal. Whatever the hijacking process involves, we must presume that an intermediate stage of infection between contamination and zombification is fatal. If I had to guess, the infection of the medulla oblogata – where most automatic processes are regulated – is what results in cardio-pulmonary death, followed shortly by brain-death. Sometime after brain-death the medulla is fully hijacked by the zombie pathogen, jump-started (I won’t attempt an explanation) and re-animation is underway.</p><p>Whether it is musculature, perceptive organs, or circulatory and digestive systems, the virus must work with what it has. The metabolic process continues, arguably for both the body and the pathogen, which in large part informs the indiscriminate hunger for flesh. It is critical here to note that a zombie body is not uniquely strong (in fact, the opposite), nor can the body function <em>properly</em> without oxygen, waste disposal, and nutrients. We can, however, presume that a zombie body can, in its own way, marginally function when some of these requirements are missing. However, when an eyeball is gone or the intestines finally rupture, that zombie has lost whatever sense or function was associated with the now deteriorated organ: no healing happens.</p><p>Which leads us to<strong> Condition 2</strong>, that zombies are continually decomposing. No one thinks of a zombie as a healthy, mindless body; you think of a corpse that moves. The re-animation process is, we assume, imperfect or it would be revivification. One of the imperfections is that autolysis – the process wherein a cell’s own enzymes begin to consume it – is not stopped or reversed. As autolysis is the first step in postmortem decay, even a brief period between death and re-animation would cause it to start. Other aspects of decomposition, such as purification and insect infestation, though significantly slowed would likely continue as well.</p><p>Based on the average zombie, we can presume a few things about the virus’ relationship to decomposition. First, is that the zombie virus <em>slows</em> decomposition by providing cells with some nutrients. Second, is that the immune system, at least a crippled version, still functions to slow human bacterial flora from consuming their host. Third, it could be presumed that while some cell division continues, <em>repairs</em> and <em>restoration</em> are lost. Fourth, the virus would likely only preserve essential functions, allowing irrelevant parts of the body, such as skin, secondary musculature, and some organs to decay. Finally, we can presume the virus itself<em></em>must<em></em>consume flesh to some degree, rendering the zombie’s metabolic processes incredibly inefficient and explaining the insatiability of a zombie.<em></em>Thus, a zombie frozen in the arctic would likely re-animate upon thaw (pathogen in stasis; corpse preserved) while a zombie at the bottom of the ocean would first suffocate (albeit more slowly) and then be crushed.</p><p><strong>Condition 3</strong>, that the pathogen is contagious via bodily fluids only, is a critical detail in terms of both staying true to the mythology of zombies and for presenting a scenario in which not everyone would instantly be zombified. An airborne pathogen, particularly one with any sort of incubation period, would be total, unstoppable pandemic. But, more importantly, we are dealing with a creature of fiction. And, just as with other members of the undead (e.g. vampires, werewolves) the bite gets in the blood and turns you</p><p>Remember, we almost <em>never</em> see someone getting bitten by a zombie and then not dying and “coming back.” The reason is that a bite both by-passes traditional levels of the immune system and delivers a <em>huge</em> dose of the pathogen directly into the circulatory system. Furthermore, it immediately contaminates the flesh directly exposed.

Below I&#8217;ve placed myself in the more local context of populations to which I&#8217;m close to:</p><p><span id=\"more-7494\"></span></p><p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-7495\" title=\"ADMIXTURE10\" src=\"http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/gnxp/files/2010/10/ADMIXTURE101.png\" alt=\"ADMIXTURE10\" width=\"557\" height=\"659\"/></p><p>Here <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_UOHFTxL-bOA/TMqOGjTo06I/AAAAAAAAAEk/Bd_zjjYDEOY/s1600/ADMIXTURE10.png\">are all the populations</a>.</p><p><a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karnataka\">Karnataka</a> is a state in northwest South India, and can be taken as somewhat representative of the Dravidian populations. The purple component is a South Asia distinctive element. Using the terminology of <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v461/n7263/abs/nature08365.html\">Reich et al.</a> it would be the ancient stabilized hybrid population which came out of the admixture of Ancient North Indians (ANI) and Ancient South Indians (ASI). On the margins I assume there&#8217;s just noise popping out; e.g., the &#8220;East Asian&#8221; sliver among the Kannada speakers from South India. On the other hand, the Burusho have shown evidence of East Asian admixture in other studies I&#8217;ve seen. They have a bit of the derived East Asian <em>EDAR </em>variant for example.</p><p>As for me, <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/gnxp/2010/08/pca-razib-around-the-world-a-little/\">no surprise</a><a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/gnxp/2010/09/the-confusions-of-genetic-distance/\">that I have a lot</a> of &#8220;East Asian&#8221; for a South Asian. Since Dienekes is more interested in Western Eurasia he didn&#8217;t go to the point of dividing the East Asians into a northern and southern branch. I&#8217;m pretty sure I&#8217;d be in the southern branch, along with the Miaozu sample (more well known as Hmong to Americans). The bigger question is how atypical for an <em>east </em>South Asian I am. There is a <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/gnxp/2010/10/sons-of-the-conquerers-the-story-of-india/\">certain basal load</a> of East Asian ancestry among northeast South Asian Indo-Aryan speakers. Another question is whether my East Asian component can be attributed to <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/gnxp/2010/10/sons-of-the-conquerers-the-story-of-india/\">the Mundari substrate</a> absorbed by Indo-Aryans in northeast India, or by a more recent admixture of Tibeto-Burmans. Some of both surely, but knowing my family&#8217;s long residence on the <em>eastern</em> margins of the Indo-Aryan speaking domains of South Asia, cheek-by-jowl with Tibeto-Burmans, I believe I am likely to have some recent Burmese ancestry. Specifically through my paternal grandfather.</p><p>Finally, though it is just as likely to be nothing, I have a bit more &#8220;Southern European&#8221; than the other South Asians. I assume this is from my great-grandfather who was from Delhi, and part of the polyglot Muslim religious intellectual class of that city. His physical type, which my maternal grandmother inherited, was clearly West Asian. He probably had non-trivial Persian or Central Asian ancestry.</p><div class=\"feedflare\"><a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/DiscoverMag?a=-bjvQZwpmuM:pBiasaqtfqE:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/DiscoverMag?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a><a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/DiscoverMag?a=-bjvQZwpmuM:pBiasaqtfqE:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/DiscoverMag?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a><a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/DiscoverMag?a=-bjvQZwpmuM:pBiasaqtfqE:F7zBnMyn0Lo\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/DiscoverMag?i=-bjvQZwpmuM:pBiasaqtfqE:F7zBnMyn0Lo\" border=\"0\"></img></a><a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/DiscoverMag?a=-bjvQZwpmuM:pBiasaqtfqE:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/DiscoverMag?i=-bjvQZwpmuM:pBiasaqtfqE:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></img></a></div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/DiscoverMag/~4/-bjvQZwpmuM\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\"/>") (feedburner:origLink nil "http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/gnxp/2010/10/my-dodecad-results/")) (item nil (title nil "“Octopus Head War” Pits Korean Health Officials Against Fishermen | Discoblog") (link nil "http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/DiscoverMag/~3/SVKyiHTWnwU/") (description nil "Charges by South Korean health officials that octopus heads contain large and unhealthy amounts of the heavy medal cadmium have sparked a war with the fishermen who profit from the $35 million-a-year trade.

This humanoid robot was designed by NASA and General Motors to work alongside astronauts on the space station, and could eventually take over some tedious or dangerous tasks.</p><p>Human beings who <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.nasajobs.nasa.gov/astronauts/\">dream of becoming astronauts</a> acquire things like advanced science degrees or the ability to fly jet planes in hopes of catching NASA&#8217;s eye and being chosen as astronaut candidates. If they do become candidates, there&#8217;s still scads of training before they can take a flight up to the ISS. But how does a robot qualify for and prepare for that trip to orbit? DISCOVER spoke with Marty Linn, General Motor&#8217;s principal engineer of robotics, to find out.</p><p><span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\"><strong>Qualifications</strong></span></p><p><strong>Physical Fitness:</strong> Human astronauts have to pass the NASA long-duration space flight physical to prove that they&#8217;re healthy, fit, and strong enough for astronaut duties. Robonaut 2 has to be pretty strong, too: Here on Earth, he proved that he can do arm curls with 20-pound free weights. &#8220;The limitation is grasp strength,&#8221; says Linn. &#8220;The weak link is how strong the fingers are.&#8221; The robot didn&#8217;t have to spend any time on the treadmill, though, because this model doesn&#8217;t have lower limbs—it&#8217;s simply a torso with arms and a head.</p><p><strong>Intelligence:</strong> To be honest, R2 (as its buddies call it) isn&#8217;t that bright—it can&#8217;t make independent decisions. NASA&#8217;s top priority for the experimental bot is guaranteeing that it won&#8217;t pose a threat to the astronauts or the space station, so for now R2 will be under the strict control of astronauts and ground crew. Linn explains that its actions can be programmed joint by joint, or it can be controlled by a tele-ops system, in which an astronaut dons the tele-ops gear and puts the robot through its paces by moving her own arms or head.</p><p><strong>Vision:</strong> NASA has always paid careful attention to the eyesight of its astronaut candidates, and <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.wired.com/wiredscience/2007/09/nasa-approves-a/\">only recently decided</a> that people who have gotten laser surgery to correct their vision can still be considered for the job. R2&#8217;s vision is top-notch. It&#8217;s equipped with high-resolution digital cameras, can detect motion and distinct objects, and has a 3D mapping tool to allow it to determine where objects are in space. It also has lower resolution cameras for tele-operation, Linn explains, which &#8220;allow the operator to see through the eyes of the robot.&#8221;</p><p><strong><span id=\"more-22064\"></span>Dexterity:</strong> This isn&#8217;t a top priority for NASA when selecting human astronauts, but it was a big factor in R2&#8217;s selection. Linn explains that R2 is one of the most nimble-fingered robots ever built. &#8220;Traditional robots don&#8217;t do well in an unstructured environment, where the objects aren&#8217;t rigid,&#8221; he says. &#8220;It&#8217;s very difficult for them to grasp a flexible object like a space blanket.&#8221; R2 can handle not only flexible objects, but can also deal with the small switches and cables that astronauts routinely work with on the space station.</p><p><span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\"><strong>Training</strong></span></p><p><strong>Microgravity: </strong>An important part of astronauts’ training is exposing them to the weightlessness they’ll experience in orbit. NASA handles the prep with a modified jet plane that <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weightlessness#Reduced_weight_in_aircraft\">flies in long parabolic arcs</a> to produce brief, half-minute bursts of weightlessness; fully suited astronauts also train for zero-G spacewalks in a water tank called the <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://dx12.jsc.nasa.gov/site/index.shtml\">Neutral Buoyancy Laboratory</a>. That’s one big gap in R2’s preparations for spaceflight: It has no experience with microgravity. Obviously R2 couldn&#8217;t be dunked in the pool, and the parabolic flights wouldn&#8217;t provide enough time to do meaningful tests of R2&#8217;s capabilities, Linn says. &#8220;The best experiment will be on the space station,&#8221; says Linn. That&#8217;s when the engineers will learn whether the procedures they tried on Earth will translate to orbit.</p><p><strong>Health Check:</strong> The flight crew for the ill-fated <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apollo_13\">Apollo 13</a> mission was famously changed at last minute, when pilot Ken Mattingly was grounded due to his exposure to German measles. The final health checks for R2 were a little different. The engineering team wasn&#8217;t worried about biological contaminants, but they did need to check for chemical hazards. &#8220;The robot did go to <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_Sands_Test_Facility\">White Sands [Test Facility]</a>, and it went through a bunch of outgassing tests,&#8221; Linn says. &#8220;They put him in a chamber to see what kinds of chemicals were coming off this thing, to make sure it was all safe for humans to breathe.&#8221;</p><p><strong>Spacesuit Fitting:</strong> Just like human astronauts, R2 had to get suited up for space. Its original &#8220;skin&#8221; of Lycra and neoprene didn&#8217;t meet the Space Station&#8217;s stringent flammability requirements, so it was swapped out for a fire-resistant spacesuit material. The new skin is made of Kevlar, Teflon, and Nomex.</p><p><strong>Practice for Mission:</strong> Astronauts practice for their missions with shuttle simulators and <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://dx14.jsc.nasa.gov/svmf.htm\">full-sized mockups</a> of the Space Station&#8217;s flight deck and payload bay. Operating on a more modest scale, R2 has practiced with a task board that has &#8220;typical switches that are found on the space station, and different kinds of buttons,&#8221; says Linn. Since R2 is the first of its kind, it won&#8217;t be given any crucial tasks aboard the ISS; once it&#8217;s unpacked and set up it will be put into action so that engineers can study its capabilities and limitations in zero-G. Eventually, they may let R2 try its hand at one tedious task: cleaning. &#8220;We&#8217;ve experimented with various kinds of cleaning tasks, like cleaning air filters and wiping down surfaces,&#8221; says Linn.</p><p><strong>Preparing for Travel:</strong> The astronauts who will fly on mission <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/shuttle/shuttlemissions/sts133/index.html\">STS-133</a> won&#8217;t climb aboard the shuttle until Tuesday (assuming the launch date remains the same), but R2 is already stowed safely in the cargo bay. Here&#8217;s a time-lapse video from NASA&#8217;s Kennedy Space Center showing how R2 got prepped for flight and packed up:</p><p><iframe class=\"embeddedvideo\" type=\"application/x-shockwave-flash\" width=\"600\" height=\"363\" src=\"http://www.youtube.com/v/IknEwPT6ekQ?fs=1&amp;hl=en_US&amp;rel=0\"></iframe></p><p><span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\"><strong>The Future</strong></span></p><p><strong>Upgrades:</strong> NASA and General Motors have grand hopes for R2, and say this experimental bot can be upgraded to become more functional. Lower limbs would let the robot move around the space station on its own, and engineers have already experimented with a number of different movement systems. One strong argument for lower limbs: They would provide both stability and maneuverability, which could also allow R2 to take part in spacewalks. Says Linn: &#8220;From a time constraint point of view, it&#8217;s a lot easier to send the robot outside that for an astronaut to get all suited up and go outside.&#8221;</p><p><strong>No Return: </strong>One thing that NASA didn&#8217;t have to worry about when preparing R2 for his trip was psychology. If you told human astronauts that they&#8217;d be taking a one-way trip to the space station, they&#8217;d be pretty upset. Not so with R2. This robonaut isn&#8217;t coming back, but will instead remain on the ISS for as long as the space station is in orbit. But it doesn&#8217;t seem alarmed about the prospect. As R2 recently proclaimed on <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://twitter.com/#!/AstroRobonaut\">its Twitter feed</a>, &#8220;I&#8217;m living on the station as long as there is a station.

Astronomers took advantage of the close pass to ping the comet with radar pulses.

We&#8217;ve only seen a handful of comets up close, and in general the nuclei are potato-shaped, so this one fits that description. <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.naic.edu/~pradar/103P/\">The image</a> has a scale of about 75 meters per pixel.</p><p>These observations were made to help out <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/2008/02/10/epoxi-sticks-like-glue-to-extrasolar-planets/\">the EPOXI space mission</a>, which will pass just 700 km (420 miles) from the nucleus of Hartley 2 on November 4.

I have always wanted this Lakeshore kit to assist my instruction in science. I know that the students will be excited when they are able to work in groups and pairs to understand scientific concepts using this set. Words cannot express how thankful I am to each and every one of you for your contribution to our classroom!&#8221; &#8212; Ms. L, Forsyth, Georgia </p><p>&#8220;The items that you will provide for my students will help them with counting. Can you imagine the look on their faces when they see all the resources that they will get? I can.

So is the vague, festering worry about the Chinese supercomputer justified? Let&#8217;s look at both sides of the argument.</p><p><span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\"><strong>Yes</strong></span></p><p>Putting aside the issue of our wounded national pride, some experts say the real concern is whether the United States has the organization to match what China has done. <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://news.cnet.com/8301-13924_3-20021122-64.html\">CNET interviewed Jack Dongarra</a> of Oak Ridge National Laboratory, keeper of the former fastest supercomputer, who called China&#8217;s achievement a &#8220;wake-up call.&#8221;</p><p style=\"padding-left:30px;\"><span id=\"more-22053\"></span>You have to remember that you have to not only invest in the hardware. It&#8217;s like a race car. In order to run the race car, you need a driver. You need to effectively use the machine. And we need to invest in various levels within the supercomputer ecology. The ecology is made up of the hardware, the operating system, the compiler, the applications, the numerical libraries, and so on. And you have to maintain an investment across that whole software stack in order to effectively use the hardware. And that&#8217;s an aspect that sometimes we forget about. It&#8217;s underfunded.

<p> A bolt of excitement ran through the field of cardiology in the early 1980s when <a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external-link\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.americanheart.org/presenter.jhtml?identifier=153\">anti-arrhythmia drugs</a> burst onto the scene. Researchers knew that heart-attack victims with steady heartbeats had the best odds of survival, so a medication that could tamp down irregularities seemed like a no-brainer. The drugs became the standard of care for heart-attack patients and were soon smoothing out heartbeats in intensive care wards across the United States.</p>
<p>But in the early 1990s, cardiologists realized that the drugs were also doing something else: killing about 56,000 heart-attack patients a year. Yes, hearts were beating more regularly on the drugs than off, but their owners were, on average, one-third as likely to pull through. Cardiologists had been so focused on immediately measurable arrhythmias that they had overlooked the longer-term but far more important variable of death.</p>
<p>The fundamental error here is summed up in an old joke scientists love to tell. Late at night, a police officer finds a drunk man crawling around on his hands and knees under a streetlight. The drunk man tells the officer he’s looking for his wallet. When the officer asks if he’s sure this is where he dropped the wallet, the man replies that he thinks he more likely dropped it across the street. Then why are you looking over here? the befuddled officer asks. Because the light’s better here, explains the drunk man.</p>
<p>That fellow is in good company. Many, and possibly most, scientists spend their careers looking for answers where the light is better rather than where the truth is more likely to lie. They don’t always have much choice. It is often extremely difficult or even impossible to cleanly measure what is really important, so scientists instead cleanly measure what they can, hoping it turns out to be relevant. After all, we expect scientists to quantify their observations precisely. As Lord Kelvin put it more than a century ago, “When you can measure what you are speaking about, and express it in numbers, you know something about it”...</p>

<p> A bolt of excitement ran through the field of cardiology in the early 1980s when <a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external-link\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.americanheart.org/presenter.jhtml?identifier=153\">anti-arrhythmia drugs</a> burst onto the scene. Researchers knew that heart-attack victims with steady heartbeats had the best odds of survival, so a medication that could tamp down irregularities seemed like a no-brainer. The drugs became the standard of care for heart-attack patients and were soon smoothing out heartbeats in intensive care wards across the United States.</p>
<p>But in the early 1990s, cardiologists realized that the drugs were also doing something else: killing about 56,000 heart-attack patients a year. Yes, hearts were beating more regularly on the drugs than off, but their owners were, on average, one-third as likely to pull through. Cardiologists had been so focused on immediately measurable arrhythmias that they had overlooked the longer-term but far more important variable of death.</p>
<p>The fundamental error here is summed up in an old joke scientists love to tell. Late at night, a police officer finds a drunk man crawling around on his hands and knees under a streetlight. The drunk man tells the officer he’s looking for his wallet. When the officer asks if he’s sure this is where he dropped the wallet, the man replies that he thinks he more likely dropped it across the street. Then why are you looking over here? the befuddled officer asks. Because the light’s better here, explains the drunk man.</p>
<p>That fellow is in good company. Many, and possibly most, scientists spend their careers looking for answers where the light is better rather than where the truth is more likely to lie. They don’t always have much choice. It is often extremely difficult or even impossible to cleanly measure what is really important, so scientists instead cleanly measure what they can, hoping it turns out to be relevant. After all, we expect scientists to quantify their observations precisely. As Lord Kelvin put it more than a century ago, “When you can measure what you are speaking about, and express it in numbers, you know something about it”...</p>

In honor of that, we’re discussing The Ethics of the Undead here at <strong>Science, Not Fiction</strong>. This is part II of IV. </em></p><p>Before we can start investigating whether or not something that craves brains has a mind or should be pitied, we need to define just what, exactly, we’re talking about when we talk about zombies.</p><p>I’m going to start by ruling out the <em>28 Days Later </em>zombies and the voodoo/demonic zombies of <em>Evil Dead</em>. First, the name of this blog is <strong>Science, not Fiction<em>, </em></strong>which means any religious hokum is right out the door. Demon possession, souls back from Hell, and voodoo are <em>not</em> going to be considered in this investigation. On the other end of the spectrum, in <em>28 Days Later</em> anything infected with “Rage” becomes a “fast” zombie. In essence, Rage is rabies only way, way scarier. Thus we aren’t dealing with the “undead” so much as the violently insane. So non-fatal pathogens don’t count either. If the pathogen doesn’t <em>first</em> kill you, then re-animate you, then you aren’t a zombie.</p><p>Which leads us to the next question: how does the pathogen work? I am not denying here the multitude of variations and nuances among zombie plague viruses, so we have to come up with a generic, realistic version to have our discussion. Zombies generally meet three important criteria. They are 1) stimulus-response creatures that seek flesh 2) continually decomposing and 3) contagious via bodily fluids. If we can explain, reasonably, how and for what reason a pathogen might cause/allow these conditions, we can describe a realistic zombie pathogen.</p><p><strong>Condition 1</strong>, that zombies are stimulus-response creatures that seek flesh, implies that the pathogen must act to re-animate the existing neural pathways and motor functions in some fashion. Let us presume human-only infection and that the virus, being species specific, results in a cannibalism preference. Thus the sensory systems which are re-activated are capable of distinguishing four key things: flesh-vs-not-flesh; species; infected-vs-uninfected; self. Furthermore, for the sake of simplicity, the virus does not <em>create</em> any new systems, it merely hijacks existing ones.</p><p>Next, we have to remember that contracting the zombie pathogen is terminal. Whatever the hijacking process involves, we must presume that an intermediate stage of infection between contamination and zombification is fatal. If I had to guess, the infection of the medulla oblogata – where most automatic processes are regulated – is what results in cardio-pulmonary death, followed shortly by brain-death. Sometime after brain-death the medulla is fully hijacked by the zombie pathogen, jump-started (I won’t attempt an explanation) and re-animation is underway.</p><p>Whether it is musculature, perceptive organs, or circulatory and digestive systems, the virus must work with what it has. The metabolic process continues, arguably for both the body and the pathogen, which in large part informs the indiscriminate hunger for flesh. It is critical here to note that a zombie body is not uniquely strong (in fact, the opposite), nor can the body function <em>properly</em> without oxygen, waste disposal, and nutrients. We can, however, presume that a zombie body can, in its own way, marginally function when some of these requirements are missing. However, when an eyeball is gone or the intestines finally rupture, that zombie has lost whatever sense or function was associated with the now deteriorated organ: no healing happens.</p><p>Which leads us to<strong> Condition 2</strong>, that zombies are continually decomposing. No one thinks of a zombie as a healthy, mindless body; you think of a corpse that moves. The re-animation process is, we assume, imperfect or it would be revivification. One of the imperfections is that autolysis – the process wherein a cell’s own enzymes begin to consume it – is not stopped or reversed. As autolysis is the first step in postmortem decay, even a brief period between death and re-animation would cause it to start. Other aspects of decomposition, such as purification and insect infestation, though significantly slowed would likely continue as well.</p><p>Based on the average zombie, we can presume a few things about the virus’ relationship to decomposition. First, is that the zombie virus <em>slows</em> decomposition by providing cells with some nutrients. Second, is that the immune system, at least a crippled version, still functions to slow human bacterial flora from consuming their host. Third, it could be presumed that while some cell division continues, <em>repairs</em> and <em>restoration</em> are lost. Fourth, the virus would likely only preserve essential functions, allowing irrelevant parts of the body, such as skin, secondary musculature, and some organs to decay. Finally, we can presume the virus itself<em></em>must<em></em>consume flesh to some degree, rendering the zombie’s metabolic processes incredibly inefficient and explaining the insatiability of a zombie.<em></em>Thus, a zombie frozen in the arctic would likely re-animate upon thaw (pathogen in stasis; corpse preserved) while a zombie at the bottom of the ocean would first suffocate (albeit more slowly) and then be crushed.</p><p><strong>Condition 3</strong>, that the pathogen is contagious via bodily fluids only, is a critical detail in terms of both staying true to the mythology of zombies and for presenting a scenario in which not everyone would instantly be zombified. An airborne pathogen, particularly one with any sort of incubation period, would be total, unstoppable pandemic. But, more importantly, we are dealing with a creature of fiction. And, just as with other members of the undead (e.g. vampires, werewolves) the bite gets in the blood and turns you</p><p>Remember, we almost <em>never</em> see someone getting bitten by a zombie and then not dying and “coming back.” The reason is that a bite both by-passes traditional levels of the immune system and delivers a <em>huge</em> dose of the pathogen directly into the circulatory system. Furthermore, it immediately contaminates the flesh directly exposed.

In honor of that, we&#8217;re discussing The Ethics of the Undead here at <strong>Science, Not Fiction</strong>. This is part II of IV. </em></p><p>Before we can start investigating whether or not something that craves brains has a mind or should be pitied, we need to define just what, exactly, we’re talking about when we talk about zombies.</p><p>I’m going to start by ruling out the <em>28 Days Later </em>zombies and the voodoo/demonic zombies of <em>Evil Dead</em>. First, the name of this blog is <strong>Science, not Fiction<em>, </em></strong>which means any religious hokum is right out the door. Demon possession, souls back from Hell, and voodoo are <em>not</em> going to be considered in this investigation. On the other end of the spectrum, in <em>28 Days Later</em> anything infected with “Rage” becomes a “fast” zombie. In essence, Rage is rabies only way, way scarier. Thus we aren’t dealing with the “undead” so much as the violently insane. So non-fatal pathogens don’t count either. If the pathogen doesn’t <em>first</em> kill you, then re-animate you, then you aren’t a zombie.</p><p>Which leads us to the next question: how does the pathogen work? I am not denying here the multitude of variations and nuances among zombie plague viruses, so we have to come up with a generic, realistic version to have our discussion. Zombies generally meet three important criteria. They are 1) stimulus-response creatures that seek flesh 2) continually decomposing and 3) contagious via bodily fluids. If we can explain, reasonably, how and for what reason a pathogen might cause/allow these conditions, we can describe a realistic zombie pathogen.</p><p><strong>Condition 1</strong>, that zombies are stimulus-response creatures that seek flesh, implies that the pathogen must act to re-animate the existing neural pathways and motor functions in some fashion. Let us presume human-only infection and that the virus, being species specific, results in a cannibalism preference. Thus the sensory systems which are re-activated are capable of distinguishing four key things: flesh-vs-not-flesh; species; infected-vs-uninfected; self. Furthermore, for the sake of simplicity, the virus does not <em>create</em> any new systems, it merely hijacks existing ones.</p><p>Next, we have to remember that contracting the zombie pathogen is terminal. Whatever the hijacking process involves, we must presume that an intermediate stage of infection between contamination and zombification is fatal. If I had to guess, the infection of the medulla oblogata – where most automatic processes are regulated – is what results in cardio-pulmonary death, followed shortly by brain-death. Sometime after brain-death the medulla is fully hijacked by the zombie pathogen, jump-started (I won’t attempt an explanation) and re-animation is underway.</p><p>Whether it is musculature, perceptive organs, or circulatory and digestive systems, the virus must work with what it has. The metabolic process continues, arguably for both the body and the pathogen, which in large part informs the indiscriminate hunger for flesh. It is critical here to note that a zombie body is not uniquely strong (in fact, the opposite), nor can the body function <em>properly</em> without oxygen, waste disposal, and nutrients. We can, however, presume that a zombie body can, in its own way, marginally function when some of these requirements are missing. However, when an eyeball is gone or the intestines finally rupture, that zombie has lost whatever sense or function was associated with the now deteriorated organ: no healing happens.</p><p>Which leads us to<strong> Condition 2</strong>, that zombies are continually decomposing. No one thinks of a zombie as a healthy, mindless body; you think of a corpse that moves. The re-animation process is, we assume, imperfect or it would be revivification. One of the imperfections is that autolysis – the process wherein a cell’s own enzymes begin to consume it – is not stopped or reversed. As autolysis is the first step in postmortem decay, even a brief period between death and re-animation would cause it to start. Other aspects of decomposition, such as purification and insect infestation, though significantly slowed would likely continue as well.</p><p>Based on the average zombie, we can presume a few things about the virus’ relationship to decomposition. First, is that the zombie virus <em>slows</em> decomposition by providing cells with some nutrients. Second, is that the immune system, at least a crippled version, still functions to slow human bacterial flora from consuming their host. Third, it could be presumed that while some cell division continues, <em>repairs</em> and <em>restoration</em> are lost. Fourth, the virus would likely only preserve essential functions, allowing irrelevant parts of the body, such as skin, secondary musculature, and some organs to decay. Finally, we can presume the virus itself<em></em>must<em></em>consume flesh to some degree, rendering the zombie’s metabolic processes incredibly inefficient and explaining the insatiability of a zombie.<em></em>Thus, a zombie frozen in the arctic would likely re-animate upon thaw (pathogen in stasis; corpse preserved) while a zombie at the bottom of the ocean would first suffocate (albeit more slowly) and then be crushed.</p><p><strong>Condition 3</strong>, that the pathogen is contagious via bodily fluids only, is a critical detail in terms of both staying true to the mythology of zombies and for presenting a scenario in which not everyone would instantly be zombified. An airborne pathogen, particularly one with any sort of incubation period, would be total, unstoppable pandemic. But, more importantly, we are dealing with a creature of fiction. And, just as with other members of the undead (e.g. vampires, werewolves) the bite gets in the blood and turns you</p><p>Remember, we almost <em>never</em> see someone getting bitten by a zombie and then not dying and “coming back.” The reason is that a bite both by-passes traditional levels of the immune system and delivers a <em>huge</em> dose of the pathogen directly into the circulatory system. Furthermore, it immediately contaminates the flesh directly exposed. As the zombie pathogen, whatever it is, seems able to interact with most cell types, not just specific ones (as with HIV), it would make sense that direct exposure would allow the virus both permeate the whole system (body) while beginning total infection at the site of contamination as well. It only takes one bite!</p><p>There you have it. A zombie pathogen must 1) be transmitted via bodily-fluids to 2) ensure sufficient and total infection which 3) is always fatal due to the fact that pathogen must 4) either consume the host or host-acquired flesh 5) hijack all the necessary functions for movement and sensation 6) provide at least some nutrients to itself and the body 7) allow continued movement and <img src='http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/sciencenotfiction/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_cool.gif' alt='8)' class='wp-smiley'/> slow the decomposition of the host body.</p><p><em>Promotional Image via <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.amctv.com/originals/The-Walking-Dead/\">AMCtv.com</a> by Scott Garfield</em></p><p><a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://feedads.g.doubleclick.net/~a/6dthtDiiTkn1gC4GfqqBTNdcRYg/0/da\"><img src=\"http://feedads.g.doubleclick.net/~a/6dthtDiiTkn1gC4GfqqBTNdcRYg/0/di\" border=\"0\" ismap></a><br/><a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://feedads.g.doubleclick.net/~a/6dthtDiiTkn1gC4GfqqBTNdcRYg/1/da\"><img src=\"http://feedads.g.doubleclick.net/~a/6dthtDiiTkn1gC4GfqqBTNdcRYg/1/di\" border=\"0\" ismap></a></p><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ScienceNotFiction/~4/23gtoZPB160\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\"/><div class=\"feedflare\"><a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/DiscoverMag?a=t1NfCy8bCkU:MKx0n0Buir4:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/DiscoverMag?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a><a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/DiscoverMag?a=t1NfCy8bCkU:MKx0n0Buir4:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/DiscoverMag?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a><a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/DiscoverMag?a=t1NfCy8bCkU:MKx0n0Buir4:F7zBnMyn0Lo\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/DiscoverMag?i=t1NfCy8bCkU:MKx0n0Buir4:F7zBnMyn0Lo\" border=\"0\"></img></a><a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/DiscoverMag?a=t1NfCy8bCkU:MKx0n0Buir4:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/DiscoverMag?i=t1NfCy8bCkU:MKx0n0Buir4:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></img></a></div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/DiscoverMag/~4/t1NfCy8bCkU\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\"/>") (feedburner:origLink nil "http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/ScienceNotFiction/~3/23gtoZPB160/"))) ("Plastic Chemical BPA Linked to Lower Sperm Count & Quality | 80beats" "<p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-22081\" title=\"sperm-2\" src=\"http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/80beats/files/2010/10/sperm-2.jpg\" alt=\"sperm-2\" width=\"220\" height=\"217\" align=\"right\"/>A new study of 218 Chinese men found that even low levels of the controversial plastics chemical bisphenol A <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bisphenol_A\">(BPA)</a> can lower sperm quality and count.</p><p>For the <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.fertstert.org/article/S0015-0282(10)02587-2/abstract\">study</a>, which was published in the journal <em>Fertility and Sterility</em>, researchers noted the participants’ sperm quality and urine BPA levels over five years.

DISCOVER spoke with Marty Linn, General Motor’s principal engineer of robotics, to find out.</p><p><span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\"><strong>Qualifications</strong></span></p><p><strong>Physical Fitness:</strong> Human astronauts have to pass the NASA long-duration space flight physical to prove that they’re healthy, fit, and strong enough for astronaut duties. Robonaut 2 has to be pretty strong, too: Here on Earth, he proved that he can do arm curls with 20-pound free weights. “The limitation is grasp strength,” says Linn. “The weak link is how strong the fingers are.” The robot didn’t have to spend any time on the treadmill, though, because this model doesn’t have lower limbs—it’s simply a torso with arms and a head.</p><p><strong>Intelligence:</strong> To be honest, R2 (as its buddies call it) isn’t that bright—it can’t make independent decisions. NASA’s top priority for the experimental bot is guaranteeing that it won’t pose a threat to the astronauts or the space station, so for now R2 will be under the strict control of astronauts and ground crew. Linn explains that its actions can be programmed joint by joint, or it can be controlled by a tele-ops system, in which an astronaut dons the tele-ops gear and puts the robot through its paces by moving her own arms or head.</p><p><strong>Vision:</strong> NASA has always paid careful attention to the eyesight of its astronaut candidates, and <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.wired.com/wiredscience/2007/09/nasa-approves-a/\">only recently decided</a> that people who have gotten laser surgery to correct their vision can still be considered for the job. R2’s vision is top-notch. It’s equipped with high-resolution digital cameras, can detect motion and distinct objects, and has a 3D mapping tool to allow it to determine where objects are in space. It also has lower resolution cameras for tele-operation, Linn explains, which “allow the operator to see through the eyes of the robot.”</p><p><strong><span id=\"more-22064\"></span>Dexterity:</strong> This isn’t a top priority for NASA when selecting human astronauts, but it was a big factor in R2’s selection. Linn explains that R2 is one of the most nimble-fingered robots ever built. “Traditional robots don’t do well in an unstructured environment, where the objects aren’t rigid,” he says. “It’s very difficult for them to grasp a flexible object like a space blanket.” R2 can handle not only flexible objects, but can also deal with the small switches and cables that astronauts routinely work with on the space station.</p><p><span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\"><strong>Training</strong></span></p><p><strong>Microgravity: </strong>An important part of astronauts’ training is exposing them to the weightlessness they’ll experience in orbit. NASA handles the prep with a modified jet plane that <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weightlessness#Reduced_weight_in_aircraft\">flies in long parabolic arcs</a> to produce brief, half-minute bursts of weightlessness; fully suited astronauts also train for zero-G spacewalks in a water tank called the <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://dx12.jsc.nasa.gov/site/index.shtml\">Neutral Buoyancy Laboratory</a>. That’s one big gap in R2’s preparations for spaceflight: It has no experience with microgravity. Obviously R2 couldn’t be dunked in the pool, and the parabolic flights wouldn’t provide enough time to do meaningful tests of R2’s capabilities, Linn says. “The best experiment will be on the space station,” says Linn. That’s when the engineers will learn whether the procedures they tried on Earth will translate to orbit.</p><p><strong>Health Check:</strong> The flight crew for the ill-fated <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apollo_13\">Apollo 13</a> mission was famously changed at last minute, when pilot Ken Mattingly was grounded due to his exposure to German measles. The final health checks for R2 were a little different. The engineering team wasn’t worried about biological contaminants, but they did need to check for chemical hazards. “The robot did go to <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_Sands_Test_Facility\">White Sands [Test Facility]</a>, and it went through a bunch of outgassing tests,” Linn says. “They put him in a chamber to see what kinds of chemicals were coming off this thing, to make sure it was all safe for humans to breathe.”</p><p><strong>Spacesuit Fitting:</strong> Just like human astronauts, R2 had to get suited up for space. Its original “skin” of Lycra and neoprene didn’t meet the Space Station’s stringent flammability requirements, so it was swapped out for a fire-resistant spacesuit material. The new skin is made of Kevlar, Teflon, and Nomex.</p><p><strong>Practice for Mission:</strong> Astronauts practice for their missions with shuttle simulators and <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://dx14.jsc.nasa.gov/svmf.htm\">full-sized mockups</a> of the Space Station’s flight deck and payload bay. Operating on a more modest scale, R2 has practiced with a task board that has “typical switches that are found on the space station, and different kinds of buttons,” says Linn. Since R2 is the first of its kind, it won’t be given any crucial tasks aboard the ISS; once it’s unpacked and set up it will be put into action so that engineers can study its capabilities and limitations in zero-G. Eventually, they may let R2 try its hand at one tedious task: cleaning. “We’ve experimented with various kinds of cleaning tasks, like cleaning air filters and wiping down surfaces,” says Linn.</p><p><strong>Preparing for Travel:</strong> The astronauts who will fly on mission <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/shuttle/shuttlemissions/sts133/index.html\">STS-133</a> won’t climb aboard the shuttle until Tuesday (assuming the launch date remains the same), but R2 is already stowed safely in the cargo bay.

As R2 recently proclaimed on <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://twitter.com/#!/AstroRobonaut\">its Twitter feed</a>, &#8220;I&#8217;m living on the station as long as there is a station.

I know that your generosity will allow students with learning disabilities to engage in hands-on activities that relate to their everyday lives in reading, writing and math.” — Ms. S, Columbus</p><p>“I AM SO EXCITED about this project being funded! I have always wanted this Lakeshore kit to assist my instruction in science. I know that the students will be excited when they are able to work in groups and pairs to understand scientific concepts using this set. Words cannot express how thankful I am to each and every one of you for your contribution to our classroom!” — Ms. L, Forsyth, Georgia </p><p>“The items that you will provide for my students will help them with counting. Can you imagine the look on their faces when they see all the resources that they will get? I can. Its a look that I constantly get when I introduce a new concept and they are interested in learning more.” — Mrs. B, Los Angeles</p></blockquote><p>We’re kicking serious butt in the <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.donorschoose.org/donors/leadershipboard.html?category=208\">Discover Blogs sub-challenge</a>, which is nice, but our collective behinds are in turn being kicked by the pretenders at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.donorschoose.org/donors/leadershipboard.html?category=208\">Seed</a>, especially the <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.donorschoose.org/donors/viewChallenge.html?id=70157&category=197&max=50\">squid people</a>.

Every donation is rewarded with a direct thank-you from the classroom that you helped. Here are a few of our responses:</p><blockquote><p>&#8220;I simply cannot thank you enough for your selfless donation for much-needed supplies to use in my classroom. I know that your generosity will allow students with learning disabilities to engage in hands-on activities that relate to their everyday lives in reading, writing and math.&#8221; &#8212; Ms. S, Columbus</p><p>&#8220;I AM SO EXCITED about this project being funded! I have always wanted this Lakeshore kit to assist my instruction in science. I know that the students will be excited when they are able to work in groups and pairs to understand scientific concepts using this set. Words cannot express how thankful I am to each and every one of you for your contribution to our classroom!&#8221; &#8212; Ms. L, Forsyth, Georgia </p><p>&#8220;The items that you will provide for my students will help them with counting. Can you imagine the look on their faces when they see all the resources that they will get? I can. Its a look that I constantly get when I introduce a new concept and they are interested in learning more.&#8221; &#8212; Mrs. B, Los Angeles</p></blockquote><p>We&#8217;re kicking serious butt in the <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.donorschoose.org/donors/leadershipboard.html?category=208\">Discover Blogs sub-challenge</a>, which is nice, but our collective behinds are in turn being kicked by the pretenders at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.donorschoose.org/donors/leadershipboard.html?category=208\">Seed</a>, especially the <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.donorschoose.org/donors/viewChallenge.html?id=70157&#038;category=197&#038;max=50\">squid people</a>.

Three new books explore the origins of human sexuality, whether we are capable of monogamy, and why we kiss.</p><p>__</p><p>In <em>The Science of Kissing: What Our Lips Are Telling Us</em> (Grand Central Publishing, 2011), biologist and science journalist Sheril Kirshenbaum explores all aspects of a lip lock. For instance, women usually require a kiss to feel intimate with another person, whereas men are more willing to forgo the first kiss and go straight for sex. Although scientists don’t know why we kiss, Kirshenbaum explores several possibilities, such as that kissing rekindles the intimacy we first experienced in infancy when breastfeeding.</p></blockquote><p>It&#8217;s exciting as an author to see the first nod to a project that has taken years of research, experimentation, and composition.

Every time “<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOnqjkJTMaA\">Thriller</a>” comes on you probably <em>dance </em>like a zombie.

Has the question ever popped up in your quite-live brain: is it ok to kill a zombie? Could a zombie be cured? If you could cure it, would you still want to? In honor of Halloween and our culture’s current love affair with brain-eating corpses, I present The Ethics of the Undead, your universal guide for answering all of your most pressing zombie questions.

Every time “<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOnqjkJTMaA\">Thriller</a>” comes on you probably <em>dance </em>like a zombie.

This week, <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=dark-worlds\">that article</a> finally hit the newsstands in the November Issue.</p><p>Back in 2008, Jonathan and I had for quite a while been interested in the connections between particle physics and cosmology, and in particular how experiments at current, upcoming (the LHC at that point) and future colliders could inform and be informed by modern cosmology. In fact, I’d <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/cosmicvariance/2007/06/26/constraints-and-signatures-in-particle-cosmology/\">written about these connections</a> a number of times here on the blog, discussing, for example, the nature of WIMP dark matter, and the <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/cosmicvariance/2008/07/29/matter-v-antimatter-ii-electroweak-baryogenesis/\">origin of the matter-antimatter asymmetry of the universe</a>. And these were the starting point for our interactions with George about a SciAm article. </p><p>The journey from these initial musings to a final article was a mostly enjoyable and interesting one, and for me it contrasted greatly with the vast majority of writing that I do, presenting my own current research for journals. In those efforts, the editorial input is generally small. One receives referee reports that are hopefully mostly positive, and can sometimes (although rarely, to be honest) contain excellent suggestions that improve the final version of the paper. The editorial role is mostly in the selection of referees by a scientist serving on the editorial board, and in general grammatical editing of the paper and verification of references as it nears the publication date.</p><p>But writing for a magazine is a different experience. From the beginning it was very much a collaborative effort, with Jonathan and I honing our ideas about what should appear in the article, and George pushing some ideas and downplaying others, to fit with his experience of the kind of article that most readers want. We were all searching for the right mix of background material, new directions in the field, and connections to work that Jonathan and I had been directly involved in, and so could comment on from direct experience. Although we didn’t always agree, it was definitely a constructive process, and the final content was a consensus in the best sense of the word, with what to emphasize and what couldn’t make it into the article for space reasons (which are very tight) the outcome of lengthy, but useful negotiations between us and George. That it took a couple of years from inception to publication is partly a reflection of the natural time it takes for a lot of back and forth between editor and authors who have busy day jobs, and partly because in the middle I moved institutions, putting me out of action for a while.</p><p>What we ended up focusing on is the intriguing possibility that the dark sector of cosmology might exhibit a considerably richer structure than our usual simple descriptions of a plain WIMP candidate for dark matter, and a cosmological constant, or sequestered dark energy component driving cosmic acceleration. Rather, it is possible that the dark sector contains it’s own set of new particles and forces, and that our detections, gravitationally based so far, have not yet been able to probe this underlying structure. We wrote about interesting possibilities for dark matter, some of which are related to <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://arXiv.org/abs/hep-ph/0306024\">work Jonathan has done</a>, for much of the article, and at the end turned to the possibility of interactions with dark energy, which <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://arXiv.org/abs/0808.1105\">I’ve worked on</a> and have occasionally written about here. As we concluded the article:</p><blockquote><p>The only matter we know anything about, visible matter, comprises a rich spectrum of particles with multiple interactions determined by beautiful underlying symmetry principles. Nothing suggests that dark matter and dark energy should be any different. We may not encounter dark stars, planets and people, but just as we could hardly imagine the solar system without Neptune, Pluto and the swarm of objects that lie even farther out, one day we might not be able to conceive of a universe without an intricate and fascinating dark world.</p></blockquote><p>The article isn’t perfect, of course. For example, there is a heading for one of the figures that reads “Experiments that claim to have detected dark matter”. We didn’t write that, but we should have caught it in proofs. It is wrong, of course, and should read something like “Experiments that are searching for dark matter”. Also, after being so close to the material for a while, there are some ambiguities that you don’t notice unless someone else reads them a different way and lets you know. But in all, I think Jonathan and I are pretty happy with the final article.</p><p>For me, it was an enjoyable experience, with several highlights. First and foremost, we had an engaged ad sympathetic editor who understood both the science and the target audience. Thanks George! Second, it is wonderful fun to receive some actual draft page proofs, after months of exchanging a visually unappealing text file, and to see the art work that has been designed to accompany the article. We had some very rough ideas regarding one or two of the figures, but most of the visual parts of the article were created with no initial input from us. We helped tweak at the end, and certainly helped with text in the figures, but the gorgeous graphics were essentially all the magazine’s work. And finally, George never even hinted to us, but when we received copies of the actual magazine a few days before it appeared, we were shocked and delighted to see that our article was the cover article. I can’t tell you how thrilled my mother will be!</p><p>Just like the newsstand version, the <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=dark-worlds\">online version of the article</a> costs money of course.

CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: These data suggest that perceivers&#8217; beliefs about who is a Democrat and Republican may be based on perceptions of traits stereotypically associated with the two political parties and that, indeed, the guidance of these stereotypes may lead to categorizations of others&#8217; political affiliations at rates significantly more accurate than chance guessing.&#8221;</p><p><a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20090906\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-13571\" title=\"democrats_republicans_faces\" src=\"http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/discoblog/files/2010/10/democrats_republicans_faces.jpg\" alt=\"democrats_republicans_faces\" width=\"450\" height=\"276\"/></a><em></em></p><p><em>Photo: flickr/<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/italintheheart/4426677321\">leoncillo sabino</a></em></p><p>Related content:<br />
