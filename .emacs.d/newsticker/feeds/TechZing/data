Sam is located in Australia and is the creator of <a href=\"http://querycell.com/\">QueryCell</a>, an Excel add-in that provides the ability to write and execute SQL queries on spreadsheet table data. He also recently released a product called <a href=\"http://www.quiznightchief.com/\">Quiz Night Chief</a>.</li><li>Sam says that while QueryCell was only just released three weeks ago, he already has customers. He cites the rule that things will take longer than you expect, even when you take that rule into account. He believes that this principle can be extended to marketing, as in &#8211; marketing will be more important than you think even when you take that into account. He says that it was a week before he got his first customer at which point he and his girlfriend celebrated and went out to dinner.</li><li>Justin expects that there will be a lot of people who will have the pain that QueryCell relieves, but wonders how you might find and market to those people. Sam explains the difficulty in marketing to a non-technical customer base as they often don&#8217;t hang out all in one place.</li><li>Sam talks about <a href=\"http://www.embarcadero.com/products/delphi/\">Delphi</a>, the platform in which he wrote QueryCell. Jason compared VB6 to Delphi and describes how much more productive it was for him to write Windows apps using VB6 than Visual C++, which he used in the 90s.</li><li>Sam talks a little bit about how he learned to write code and how he got into software development.</li><li>Sam discusses the market for Quiz Night Chief and the problem it solves.</li><li>Jason talks about the importance of having the support of significant others when pursing entrepreneurial ventures.</li><li>Sam says that he has products number three and four in the works and Justin discuses the difficulty of keeping yourself from being distracted by new projects and ideas. Justin posts all of his new software ideas on the web (giving them away for free) so that he won&#8217;t think about them anymore. Justin argues for not hedging and for focusing your energy on a single product as <a href=\"http://www.balsamiq.com/company\">Peldi Guilizzoni</a> did with <a href=\"http://www.balsamiq.com\">Balsamiq</a>, which grossed over 200K in its first year.</li><li>Sam wants to build software that will make the world a better place. Justin worries about the moral implications of building a company that competes with and potentially ruins competitors. Justin doesn&#8217;t want to be a meanie. Jason believes that competition is a necessary ingredient for innovation which net-net is an overall positive for more people.</li><li>Sam found <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_D._Carmack\">John Carmack</a>&#8216;s <a href=\"http://www.quakeunity.com/file=2739\">keynote speeches</a> at QuakeCon to be fascinating.</li><li>Justin mentions <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Berners-Lee\">Tim Berners-Lee&#8217;s</a><a href=\"http://www.ted.com/index.php/talks/tim_berners_lee_on_the_next_web.html\">talk</a> at TedTalks on the next web. He thought it was cool.  Sam and Jason aren&#8217;t convinced and agree with <a href=\"http://norvig.com/\">Peter Norvi</a>g that the semantic web will remain the future of the web for some time.</li><li>Sam brings up the <a href=\"http://www.reddit.com/r/programming/comments/8en6p/why_guido_doesnt_like_tail_recursion_elimination/\">brouhaha</a> that resulted from <a href=\"http://www.python.org/~guido/\">Guido van Rossum</a>&#8216;s unwillingness to support tail recursion in <a href=\"http://www.python.org/\">Python</a>.</li><li>Jason jokes about how his method of version control is to simply to copy the source directory to a backup directory organized by date. Justin is shocked at Jason&#8217;s brazen apostasy and launches into an extended rant about the importance of version control and specifically advocates the use of tools like <a href=\"http://tortoisesvn.tigris.org/\">Tortoise SVN</a> and <a href=\"http://beanstalkapp.com/\">Beanstalk</a> (for subversion hosting). Sam at first jokes that he may not be able to talk to Jason any longer since he doesn&#8217;t use <a href=\"http://git-scm.com/\">GIT</a> (because that&#8217;s what the cool kids use), but then admits that he doesn&#8217;t use version control either since, like Jason, he&#8217;s a lone developer.</li><li>Sam prophecizes that Facebook will have disappeared (or at least not be very important) 10 years from now, but that Google will be still be a force. Jason agrees because he believes Facebook is just a trendy service like Friendster and MySpace.</li><li>Jason discusses the current status of <a href=\"http://www.preezo.com\">Preezo</a> and it&#8217;s possible future.</li></ul>

Jason wonders if there is a way of doing <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haptic_technology\">force-feedback</a> using a vest or gloves. Justin is a little confused about what force-feedback is.</li><li>Justin thinks that Twitter is perfect for celebrities because it allows them to interact with their fans without having to get too stressed about it. Jason says that posting a tweet to a bunch of followers allows a regular person to feel like a celebrity.</li><li>Jason discusses how he changed his Twitter handle to <a href=\"http://twitter.com/exojason\">exojason</a> and reserved the domain <a href=\"http://www.exofeed.com\">exojason.com</a> because it&#8217;s finally time &#8220;to get online&#8221;. While he admits the name may suck, he&#8217;s relieved that at least it&#8217;s done and he doesn&#8217;t have to think about it anymore.</li><li>Justin gets his feelings hurt again when he posts another question on <a href=\"http://stackoverflow.com/\">Stack Overflow</a>. His question was &#8220;what is the most useful PHP function?&#8221; Jason thinks Justin&#8217;s question was really dumb and would have down-voted it himself even though he&#8217;s never down-voted a question before.</li><li>Justin and Jason talk about how a little knowledge can be a dangerous thing in programming and that the more experience you get, the more humble you become. They discuss how this plays into estimating the difficulty of a particular programming task and the length of time required to complete a project. Both agree that fixed bid projects are dangerous and won&#8217;t do fixed bids when consulting.</li><li>Jason claims that outsourcing programming projects overseas almost never works unless they are very simple in nature. He thinks that language barriers, cultural differences, lack of familiarity with the problem domain, and ineffective communication with the project sponsor are some of the reasons why outsourcing tends not to work. Justin poses <a href=\"http://www.digg.com\">Digg</a> as a counterexample, but Jason <a href=\"http://blog.mixergy.com/pr-lies-destroy-your-understanding-of-how-business-really-works-owen-byrne-digg/\">dismisses the myth</a> that somehow Kevin Rose put the Digg project up on <a href=\"http://www.elance.com/\">eLance</a> for a few thousand dollars. Justin agrees that communication barriers can prove to be a major hindrance, even if the developers are on-site and in the same room.</li><li>Justin and Jason discuss <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_H._Clark\">Jim Clark</a> and Michael Lewis&#8217;s book &#8220;<a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/New-Thing-Silicon-Valley-Story/dp/0393048136\">The New New Thing</a>, which now is not so new but still a fun read.</li><li>Justin brings up <a href=\"http://etherpad.com/\">EtherPad</a> and Jason explains the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comet_(programming)\">Comet</a> technology most likely used used by Etherpad  to achieve real-time web communication.</li><li>Justin doesn&#8217;t like the usability of <a href=\"http://www.redliner.com/\">Redliner</a> &#8211; a real-time document collaboration app that&#8217;s built in Microsoft&#8217;s <a href=\"http://silverlight.net/\">SilverLight</a>. Jason claims that SilverLight will never get enough market penetration because too many web developers hate Microsoft and because few people want to install another piece of software. Justin questions whether <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML_5\">HTML5</a> will replace Flash, but Jason doesn&#8217;t believe that Flash will be replaced by HTML 5 for a very long time because of legacy browsers.</li><li>Justin mentions <a href=\"http://www.chromeexperiments.com/\">Chrome Experiments</a> and is amazed at what can be done with a 3D rendering engine in <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canvas_(HTML_element)\">Canvas</a>. Jason discusses the competing Javascript engines &#8211; <a href=\"http://code.google.com/p/v8/\">V8</a> (Chrome), <a href=\"https://wiki.mozilla.org/JavaScript:TraceMonkey\">TraceMonkey</a> (Firefox) and Safari (<a href=\"http://webkit.org/blog/214/introducing-squirrelfish-extreme/\">SquirrelFish Extreme</a>).</li><li>Jason and Justin discuss being a purist vs a pragmatist when applying <a href=\"http://www.w3.org/Style/CSS/\">CSS</a> across browsers. Jason claims that while he likes to make his code as elegant and clean as possible, at the end of the day he&#8217;s in the &#8220;make it work&#8221; business. Justin is very frustrated by CSS incompatibility and thinks IE is the bane of everyone&#8217;s existence.</li><li>Justin &#8216;just&#8217; discovered <a href=\"http://www.google.com/patents\">Google Patent Search</a> and <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skywriting\">skywriting</a> (you know with an airplane). Jason wonders why Justin hadn&#8217;t heard about these things before.</li><li>Jason finds switching context between projects extremely difficult. Justin meditates between projects. Jason also finds it difficult to switch between coding and doing other operational and business tasks. Jason brings up a blog <a href=\"http://messynotebook.com/?p=1083\">post</a> by <a href=\"http://www.linkedin.com/pub/thomas-kjeldahl-nilsson/1/2b2/b15\">Thomas Kjeldahl</a> on <a href=\"http://messynotebook.com/\">messynotebook.com</a>, where he talks about doing a little bit of work every day on a side project to keep from having to &#8220;spin back up&#8221;.</li></ul>

Instead they trapped every keystroke and mouse event and managed the entire editing process manually.

Justin asks whether they could map it to canvas as well. Jason says that in view of the growing support for canvas going forward he would just write to the canvas API and use the <a href=\"http://code.google.com/p/explorercanvas/\">ExplorerCanvas</a> Javascript library to convert canvas API calls to VML. He also thinks that the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raster_graphics\">raster graphics</a> of canvas is more generally useful that the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vector_graphics\">vector graphics</a> supported by SVG and VML.</span></span></li><li><span style=\"word-spacing: 0px; font: 16px 'Times New Roman'; text-transform: none; color: #000000; text-indent: 0px; white-space: normal; letter-spacing: normal; border-collapse: separate; orphans: 2; widows: 2; -webkit-border-horizontal-spacing: 0px; -webkit-border-vertical-spacing: 0px; -webkit-text-decorations-in-effect: none; -webkit-text-size-adjust: auto; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px;\"><span style=\"font-size: 13px; font-family: Verdana;\">Justin wonders whether doing a startup indeed requires an entrepreneur to work 14 hours per day as <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jason_Calacanis\">Jason Calacanis</a> claims, but Jason disagrees.

Jason says that while he&#8217;s never done <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pair_programming\">pair programming</a> in a professional setting, he describes how he&#8217;s been pair programming for years with another developer located in Europe using <a href=\"http://www.skype.com/\">Skype</a> and <a href=\"http://www.uvnc.com/\">Ultra VNC</a> and finds it to be extremely productive.

Justin recounts a story of how a company he once worked for was able to entice a top notch coder simply because they had table tennis. Jason thinks that if you want to attract the best people then you need to provide an environment where people want to spend their time. He tells a story of how his first startup had a great office at the center of a cool area of town (<a href=\"http://www.oldpasadena.org/\">Old Pasadena, CA</a>) and how much fun it was.

Sam is located in Australia and is the creator of <a href=\"http://querycell.com/\">QueryCell</a>, an Excel add-in that provides the ability to write and execute SQL queries on spreadsheet table data. He also recently released a product called <a href=\"http://www.quiznightchief.com/\">Quiz Night Chief</a>.</li><li>Sam says that while QueryCell was only just released three weeks ago, he already has customers. He cites the rule that things will take longer than you expect, even when you take that rule into account. He believes that this principle can be extended to marketing, as in – marketing will be more important than you think even when you take that into account. He says that it was a week before he got his first customer at which point he and his girlfriend celebrated and went out to dinner.</li><li>Justin expects that there will be a lot of people who will have the pain that QueryCell relieves, but wonders how you might find and market to those people. Sam explains the difficulty in marketing to a non-technical customer base as they often don’t hang out all in one place.</li><li>Sam talks about <a href=\"http://www.embarcadero.com/products/delphi/\">Delphi</a>, the platform in which he wrote QueryCell. Jason compared VB6 to Delphi and describes how much more productive it was for him to write Windows apps using VB6 than Visual C++, which he used in the 90s.</li><li>Sam talks a little bit about how he learned to write code and how he got into software development.</li><li>Sam discusses the market for Quiz Night Chief and the problem it solves.</li><li>Jason talks about the importance of having the support of significant others when pursing entrepreneurial ventures.</li><li>Sam says that he has products number three and four in the works and Justin discuses the difficulty of keeping yourself from being distracted by new projects and ideas. Justin posts all of his new software ideas on the web (giving them away for free) so that he won’t think about them anymore.

Sam is located in Australia and is the creator of <a href=\"http://querycell.com/\">QueryCell</a>, an Excel add-in that provides the ability to write and execute SQL queries on spreadsheet table data. He also recently released a product called <a href=\"http://www.quiznightchief.com/\">Quiz Night Chief</a>.</li><li>Sam says that while QueryCell was only just released three weeks ago, he already has customers. He cites the rule that things will take longer than you expect, even when you take that rule into account. He believes that this principle can be extended to marketing, as in &#8211; marketing will be more important than you think even when you take that into account. He says that it was a week before he got his first customer at which point he and his girlfriend celebrated and went out to dinner.</li><li>Justin expects that there will be a lot of people who will have the pain that QueryCell relieves, but wonders how you might find and market to those people.
