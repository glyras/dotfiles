A variety of methods have been used to find them: Doppler shift of starlight as the circling planets tug their stars, the dip in light as a planet passes directly in front of its star, even the change in light of a distant star as the gravity of a planet briefly magnifies it a la Einstein. </p><p>But getting direct pictures of planets is really hard. A typical star is roughly a billion times brighter than a planet! And from our great distance, the planet and star are so close together that the former is lost in the latter&#8217;s glare.</p><p><img src=\"http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/files/2010/10/eso_betapic_apodized.jpg\" alt=\"eso_betapic_apodized\" title=\"eso_betapic_apodized\" width=\"400\" height=\"361\" class=\"alignright size-full wp-image-22446\" />But a new breakthrough <a href=\"http://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2010-10/uoa-phn101410.php\" target=\"_blank\">has just been announced</a> by astronomers at the University of Arizona &#8212; known for their ability to push the frontiers of what&#8217;s possible observationally. What they&#8217;ve done is complex, but basically, it reduces the glare from a star, allowing the fainter planet to be more easily detected. </p><p>The image here shows just such a detection! The planet orbiting the star Beta Pictoris <a href=\"http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/2010/06/10/astronomers-see-exoplanet-orbiting-its-parent-star/\" target=\"_blank\">has been known for some time</a>, so it was a good choice to test the new optical design. They knew what they were looking for, and they found it! In the image, the location of Beta Pic is indicated. The ripples around it are diffraction patterns, a bit like ripples in a pond when you drop a rock in it (though more closely related to the ripples you see when water flows around an obstacle in its path like a rock or sandbar). </p><p><span id=\"more-22445\"></span></p><p>Any time you observe a star, what you get is a bright core, and a pattern of ripples like that; it&#8217;s built into the physics of light being a wave. What the new technique does is steal a bit of light from the core and use it to suppress some of those ripples. It interferes with them, damping them down. It only works on half the image, as you can see: on the right the ripples are obvious, and on the left they are essentially gone. If you&#8217;re looking for a planet, it means you have to observe it several times rotating the detector so you can clean up the halo all the way around the star.</p><p>I&#8217;m very, very impressed with this advance. Detecting planets directly in images is extremely hard; I&#8217;ve tried to do it myself with Hubble and it was a monumental pain in the derriere. That&#8217;s why we only have a handful of planets directly seen! The planet Beta Pic b is only about 6 times the distance from its star as Earth is from the Sun, so this new technique really allows astronomers to get in close. </p><p>I expect that over the next few years we&#8217;ll be seeing this technique used to see lots of previously detected planets and confirm their existence, as well as new planets around other stars. Way back when I worked on Hubble, I tried to determine if we could use our camera to spot a Jupiter-sized planet orbiting Alpha Centauri if it had the same separation from its star as Jupiter does from the Sun (about 800 million kilometers). We were really close, but in reality it would&#8217;ve been a nearly impossible task. </p><p>I suspect this new technique may make it a whole lot easier. So stay tuned. We may be getting a lot more pictures of faint new worlds very soon!</p><p><font size=\"-2\"><em>Image credit: ESO.

There is much to see in the vast sprawl of its 5000 cubic light year volume, including young stars, still going through the pangs of birth. </p><p>One of these is the strange object called Herbig-Haro 502: a newly-born star shooting twin jets of material, far, far out into the nebula itself. Its beauty is simply breathtaking, as you can see <a href=\"http://www.spacetelescope.org/images/potw1024a/\" target=\"_blank\">in this spectacular image from Hubble</a>:</p><p><a href=\"http://www.spacetelescope.org/static/archives/images/large/potw1024a.jpg\" target=\"_blank\"><img src=\"http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/files/2010/10/hst_herbigharo.jpg\" alt=\"hst_herbigharo\" title=\"hst_herbigharo\" width=\"610\" height=\"604\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-22390\" /></a></p><p>[Click to ennebulanate to the giant 3800 x 3800 pixel version.]</p><p>Against the background gas of the Orion Nebula, HH 502, as those of us in the know call it, is almost lost &#8212; it&#8217;s the star just to the left of center wrapped in what looks like pink gauze (the jets are easier to spot in the full-res version). This image is a tiny, tiny fraction of the entire nebula, but the detail is exquisite. You can trace the jets of gas quite a ways. In real terms, the whole object is roughly a light year &#8212; 10 trillion km, 6 trillion miles &#8212; end to end. Neptune&#8217;s orbit would be a razor thin slice of a pixel on this scale. </p><p>There&#8217;s a lot to see. If you look carefully, you can see arc-shaped features all over the place. These are bow shocks, like the shock wave off the nose of a plane moving faster than sound. That&#8217;s usually caused by winds of gas screaming off of stars and slamming into the gas around it. Really elongated ones can be seen, too, and those are associated with the material firing away from the star at HH 502&#8217;s center. </p><p><span id=\"more-22339\"></span></p><p>Those jets are interesting: they are focused by a disk of material around the star far too small to be seen on this scale. But magnetic fields and other forces collimate the outflowing gas into those narrow beams. The flow of gas (which I found <a href=\"http://iopscience.iop.org/1538-3881/122/3/1508/fulltext\" target=\"_blank\">in a paper from 2001</a>) is probably something like 400 km/sec (250 miles/sec), fast enough to cross <em>the entire width of the United States</em> in 15 <em>seconds</em>. The total amount of gas in the jets is something like 0.0001 times the mass of the Sun. That may not seem like much, but it&#8217;s the same as dozens of Earths! There are knots and clumps of gas, and astronomers have judged their ages to be around a thousand years. The jets are probably older than that, but probably not by much; they&#8217;re a short-lived feature of young stars.</p><p><img src=\"http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/files/2010/10/hst_hh502_core.jpg\" alt=\"hst_hh502_core\" title=\"hst_hh502_core\" width=\"300\" height=\"295\" class=\"alignright size-full wp-image-22391\" />I got a surprise when I zoomed in on the central star in HH 502. I&#8217;ve shown the detailed image here. I expected to see the jet go all the way down to the star, but it actually appears to curve around it! What the heck&#8230;?</p><p>It&#8217;s not clear what&#8217;s going on, but I think what&#8217;s happening is that close to the star is a dense disk of dust &#8211; stars form from these kinds of disks. The gas in the nebula itself is flowing; you can see that a lot of the bow shocks are aligned such that the gas must be flowing from the lower left to the upper right. If you look at the HH 502 central star carefully, you can see on the left is another bow shock, and there is a tear-drop shaped flow around it with the pointy end to the right. The edge of the shock pattern is bright, and curves around the star. The jet itself is fainter near the star, so our eye blends it with the curved edge of the shock wave. I&#8217;m not positive about this, but that&#8217;s what it looks like to me. </p><p>In larger images, the jets are not completely straight; they can be seen to curve, like a bow. If the star is moving relative to the gas in the nebula, it&#8217;ll blow the jets back a little bit, a little bit like <a href=\"http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/2010/10/14/satellite-view-of-a-volcanic-pressure-valve/\" target=\"_blank\">the plume of a volcano gets blown by atmospheric winds</a>. </p><p>All this makes me wonder if the Sun looked like this, once, 4.55 billion years ago. There&#8217;s some evidence we were born in a gas cloud like this one, with dozens or perhaps hundreds or even thousands of other stars. Were we once swimming in a miasma of hydrogen, oxygen, sulfur, and nitrogen? Did our Sun shoot out twin beams of matter, tossed around by interstellar currents, blasted by ultraviolet light from massive stars, slammed by subatomic particles from their stellar winds?</p><p>It&#8217;s funny how we can know so much about other stars, but stuck here, billions of years in the future, we only know a little bit about our own star&#8217;s birth. But observations like this one from Hubble let us, at least, take a small glimpse into our past. </p><p><font size=\"-2\"><em>Image credit: ESA/Hubble &#038; NASA.

Detecting planets directly in images is extremely hard; I&#8217;ve tried to do it myself with Hubble and it was a monumental pain in the derriere. That&#8217;s why we only have a handful of planets directly seen! The planet Beta Pic b is only about 6 times the distance from its star as Earth is from the Sun, so this new technique really allows astronomers to get in close. </p><p>I expect that over the next few years we&#8217;ll be seeing this technique used to see lots of previously detected planets and confirm their existence, as well as new planets around other stars. Way back when I worked on Hubble, I tried to determine if we could use our camera to spot a Jupiter-sized planet orbiting Alpha Centauri if it had the same separation from its star as Jupiter does from the Sun (about 800 million kilometers). We were really close, but in reality it would&#8217;ve been a nearly impossible task. </p><p>I suspect this new technique may make it a whole lot easier. So stay tuned. We may be getting a lot more pictures of faint new worlds very soon!</p><p><font size=\"-2\"><em>Image credit: ESO.

The gas in the nebula itself is flowing; you can see that a lot of the bow shocks are aligned such that the gas must be flowing from the lower left to the upper right. If you look at the HH 502 central star carefully, you can see on the left is another bow shock, and there is a tear-drop shaped flow around it with the pointy end to the right. The edge of the shock pattern is bright, and curves around the star. The jet itself is fainter near the star, so our eye blends it with the curved edge of the shock wave. I’m not positive about this, but that’s what it looks like to me. </p><p>In larger images, the jets are not completely straight; they can be seen to curve, like a bow. If the star is moving relative to the gas in the nebula, it’ll blow the jets back a little bit, a little bit like <a href=\"http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/2010/10/14/satellite-view-of-a-volcanic-pressure-valve/\" target=\"_blank\">the plume of a volcano gets blown by atmospheric winds</a>. </p><p>All this makes me wonder if the Sun looked like this, once, 4.55 billion years ago.

See that little bright spot on the plume on the left, just above the Sun’s edge? <em>That spot is the same size as the Earth</em>. The image to the right should make that fairly clear; I made the Earth pretty close to the right size for comparison. Our planet is about 13,000 km (8000 miles) in diameter, so that one minor prominence is roughly <em>50,000 km</em> high. That’s <em>30,000 miles</em>. And it’s positively <strong>dwarfed</strong> by the Sun itself. <em>A million Earths could fit inside the Sun.</em></p><p>In case you woke up today feeling important. </p><p>I want to note that there’s a freaky optical illusion I get when I look at the top picture: if I look at one part, say the right hand edge, then quickly move my eye to the top, it appears as if the whole disk of the Sun shrinks for a moment. It’s one of those really weird illusions that’s very difficult to pin down. Anyone else see it? </p><p>Now, about that picture and how it works…</p><p>The Sun’s surface puts out light at all wavelengths, but the surface isn’t solid. It’s a gas, and it tapers off with height. Normally, a thin gas in space emits light at very specific colors as electrons jump from one energy level to another in the individual atoms. But compressed gas in the thicker, denser part of the Sun mashes together all those energies, spreading them out, so it emits white light (that layer of the Sun is called the <em>photosphere</em>). Above that layer, where the gas is thinner (in a layer called the <em>chromosphere</em>), the hydrogen does emit light at specific colors. One of these, H&alpha;, is in the red part of the spectrum, and in fact hot, thin hydrogen emits very strongly in H&alpha;.</p><p>By plopping a filter in front of a telescope, you can block a lot of the light from the photosphere but let light from the chromosphere through. That’s what Alan Friedman did — he used a filter that let through a very narrow range of colors centered on H&alpha; — to get this stunning picture. Well that, plus quite a bit of image processing! But everything you’re seeing there is real, and is happening on the Sun.</p><p><a name=\"update\"></a><em>[Update: well, mea culpa: the next paragraph is wrong. I got a note from Alan: he inverted the picture of the disk of the Sun to enhance contrast. I didn't realize this, and assumed it was natural. I knew the Sun was naturally limb-darkened in visible light due to the way gas absorbs and emits light, and also that the chromosphere was thin, so it made sense to me that in H&alpha; the Sun would be limb-brightened. Worse, I've done a lot of work with nebulae and other objects that are thin shells of gas, making them limb-brightened too. All this together led me to write the following paragraph, which turns out to be incorrect! My apologies for that, and hope it hasn't confused anyone! Now I'm off to figure out just why what I said was wrong, and the Sun is limb darkened even in H&alpha;.]</em></p><p><del datetime=\"2010-10-28T14:52:03+00:00\">Oh– see how the Sun gets brighter near the edge and darker in the middle? That’s not an illusion, it’s real. The gas emitting H&alpha; light is like a thick shell surrounding the Sun’s surface (like an atmosphere). When we look straight down on the middle of the Sun we’re looking through a few thousand kilometers of it, but as you look closer to the edge you’re seeing through more and more of the gas. The more gas you see, the more light it emits, so the edge looks brighter. In white light, the opposite is true; the Sun is dark at the edges… but that’s complicated enough <a href=\"https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki/Limb_darkening\" target=\"_blank\">that I’ll just send you here to find out why</a>. </del></p><p>All in all, an amazing and somewhat unsettling picture of a star seen close up. And it’s funny: there’s nothing in this picture I didn’t know about, or have some familiarity with. But somehow, the way Alan presents it, this picture really is amazingly <em>different</em>. </p><p>I like seeing familiar things in new ways. It jolts me out of complacency.

But this is not a space-based image from some bazillion dollar observatory! <a href=\"http://www.avertedimagination.com/img_pages/not_the_great_pumpkin.html\" target=\"_blank\">This phenomenal picture</a> was taken by astrophotographer Alan Friedman <a href=\"http://www.avertedimagination.com/images/littlebigman.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">with this relatively small (but very, very nice) &#8217;scope</a>. He shot it on October 20th, and it shows our nearest star in the light of hydrogen, specifically what astronomers call H&alpha; (H-alpha). I&#8217;ll get to that in a sec&#8230;</p><p>In this picture you can see sunspots, giant convection cells, and the gas that follows magnetic loops piercing the Sun&#8217;s surface. When we see them against the Sun&#8217;s surface they&#8217;re called <a href=\"http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/2010/04/30/sdo-opens-its-eyes-and-sees-our-star-like-never-before/\" target=\"_blank\">filaments</a>, and when they arc against the background sky on the edge of the Sun&#8217;s disk they&#8217;re called prominences. </p><p>The image he took is amazingly high-resolution! He has two closeups, <a href=\"http://www.avertedimagination.com/img_pages/great_wall.html\" target=\"_blank\">one of the filament and sunspot</a> near the edge of the disk on the left, and the other of prominences leaping up off the edge and silhouetted against the sky:</p><p><span id=\"more-23113\"></span></p><p><a href=\"http://www.avertedimagination.com/img_pages/Danse_Macabre.html\" target=\"_blank\"><img src=\"http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/files/2010/10/alanfriedman_proms_halpha.jpg\" alt=\"alanfriedman_proms_halpha\" title=\"alanfriedman_proms_halpha\" width=\"610\" height=\"440\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-23116\" /></a></p><p><img src=\"http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/files/2010/10/alanfriedman_proms_earth.jpg\" alt=\"alanfriedman_proms_earth\" title=\"alanfriedman_proms_earth\" width=\"238\" height=\"182\" class=\"alignright size-full wp-image-23120\" />Wow, that&#8217;s <em>breathtaking!</em> They look so delicate, probably because they make the Sun look fuzzy, like a comfy blanket&#8230; but have no doubts on the fury and scale of what you&#8217;re seeing here. See that little bright spot on the plume on the left, just above the Sun&#8217;s edge? <em>That spot is the same size as the Earth</em>. The image to the right should make that fairly clear; I made the Earth pretty close to the right size for comparison. Our planet is about 13,000 km (8000 miles) in diameter, so that one minor prominence is roughly <em>50,000 km</em> high. That&#8217;s <em>30,000 miles</em>. And it&#8217;s positively <strong>dwarfed</strong> by the Sun itself. <em>A million Earths could fit inside the Sun.</em></p><p>In case you woke up today feeling important. </p><p>I want to note that there&#8217;s a freaky optical illusion I get when I look at the top picture: if I look at one part, say the right hand edge, then quickly move my eye to the top, it appears as if the whole disk of the Sun shrinks for a moment. It&#8217;s one of those really weird illusions that&#8217;s very difficult to pin down. Anyone else see it? </p><p>Now, about that picture and how it works&#8230;</p><p>The Sun&#8217;s surface puts out light at all wavelengths, but the surface isn&#8217;t solid. It&#8217;s a gas, and it tapers off with height. Normally, a thin gas in space emits light at very specific colors as electrons jump from one energy level to another in the individual atoms. But compressed gas in the thicker, denser part of the Sun mashes together all those energies, spreading them out, so it emits white light (that layer of the Sun is called the <em>photosphere</em>). Above that layer, where the gas is thinner (in a layer called the <em>chromosphere</em>), the hydrogen does emit light at specific colors. One of these, H&alpha;, is in the red part of the spectrum, and in fact hot, thin hydrogen emits very strongly in H&alpha;.</p><p>By plopping a filter in front of a telescope, you can block a lot of the light from the photosphere but let light from the chromosphere through. That&#8217;s what Alan Friedman did &#8212; he used a filter that let through a very narrow range of colors centered on H&alpha; &#8212; to get this stunning picture. Well that, plus quite a bit of image processing! But everything you&#8217;re seeing there is real, and is happening on the Sun.</p><p><a name=\"update\"></a><em>[Update: well, mea culpa: the next paragraph is wrong. I got a note from Alan: he inverted the picture of the disk of the Sun to enhance contrast. I didn't realize this, and assumed it was natural. I knew the Sun was naturally limb-darkened in visible light due to the way gas absorbs and emits light, and also that the chromosphere was thin, so it made sense to me that in H&alpha; the Sun would be limb-brightened. Worse, I've done a lot of work with nebulae and other objects that are thin shells of gas, making them limb-brightened too. All this together led me to write the following paragraph, which turns out to be incorrect! My apologies for that, and hope it hasn't confused anyone! Now I'm off to figure out just why what I said was wrong, and the Sun is limb darkened even in H&alpha;.]</em></p><p><del datetime=\"2010-10-28T14:52:03+00:00\">Oh&#8211; see how the Sun gets brighter near the edge and darker in the middle? That&#8217;s not an illusion, it&#8217;s real. The gas emitting H&alpha; light is like a thick shell surrounding the Sun&#8217;s surface (like an atmosphere). When we look straight down on the middle of the Sun we&#8217;re looking through a few thousand kilometers of it, but as you look closer to the edge you&#8217;re seeing through more and more of the gas. The more gas you see, the more light it emits, so the edge looks brighter. In white light, the opposite is true; the Sun is dark at the edges&#8230; but that&#8217;s complicated enough <a href=\"https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki/Limb_darkening\" target=\"_blank\">that I&#8217;ll just send you here to find out why</a>. </del></p><p>All in all, an amazing and somewhat unsettling picture of a star seen close up. And it&#8217;s funny: there&#8217;s nothing in this picture I didn&#8217;t know about, or have some familiarity with. But somehow, the way Alan presents it, this picture really is amazingly <em>different</em>. </p><p>I like seeing familiar things in new ways. It jolts me out of complacency. What more can a skeptical scientist ask for?</p><p><br clear=\"all\"></p><hr width=\"15%\" align=\"left\"><font size=\"-2\"><em>Tip o&#8217; the sunshade to <a href=\"www.lightsinthedark.com\" target=\"_blank\">Jason Major</a>, and of course Alan Friedman for giving me permission to post his images!</em></font><br clear=\"all\"></p><p><br clear=\"all\"></p><hr width=\"30%\" align=\"left\"><font size=\"-1\"><em></p><p>Related posts:</p><p>- <a href=\"http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/2010/10/20/sdo-lunar-transit-now-with-video/\" target=\"_blank\">SDO lunar transit: now with video!</a><br />
