Duplex is a set of shell scripts (bash) that emulate duplex printing (on both sides of the paper) for sheet-fed printers that do not support duplex printing in hardware.  It can operate as a pipe so that applications can use it as a duplex printing driver. Its unique feature is its ability to print many duplex print jobs in one batch, printing the odd sides of all jobs and then the even sides in just two passes. It has a limited graphical interface.<p><strong>Changes:</strong> A limited GUI interface for batch duplex printing and deleting jobs from the print queue. A new option to preview print batches and, optionally, go ahead and print the jobs. Several bugfixes, including switching from sh to bash to eliminate script syntax errors caused by an upgrade to bash. Improved documentation.</p>

Ripcord is an PHP 5 XML-RPC server and client library with a very simple and easy to use API. You can create XML-RPC, (simplified) SOAP 1.1, and SimpleRPC clients with one call and then call RPC methods as if they were local methods of the client. You can create a server with one call, passing it any number of objects or classes whose methods it will publish and automatically document.<p><strong>Changes:</strong> This release adds an easier API for system.multiCall; you can now start multiCall queuing, code as if calling methods normally, and then execute the multiCall.

Z1 SecureMail Messenger is a server-based software solution for confidential email exchange. It enables secure communication to everyone at every place. It acts as an SMTP proxy and is completely transparent for the sender. It either delivers the message as an encrypted PDF document or stores the message on the server and provides comfortable access via Web frontend. The recpient can read the secured message with familiar software (Web browser, PDF reader). No PKI technology or certificates are required. Evaluation packages for Debian and Solaris are available for download.<p><strong>Changes:</strong> This release simplifies the initial activation process for secure mailboxes. Instead of using cryptic password parts, Z1 Messenger now acts with Activation Code and Activation PIN. Since the PIN consists of ordinary numbers, it can be easily transmitted to the recipient on a secure channel like phone or fax. In addition, it is also possible to automatically transmit the PIN via SMS to the recipient. The recipient, on the other hand, only needs to enter the PIN into an activation form and is subsequently able to receive and compose confidential messages.</p><p><a href=\"http://freshmeat.net/projects/z1securemailmessenger\"><img alt=\"Ea11fcde258f4cefcc74bc3ff352783c_thumb\" src=\"http://freshmeat.net/screenshots/ea/11/ea11fcde258f4cefcc74bc3ff352783c_thumb.png?1252339025\" /></a></p>

Zbatery is an HTTP server for Rack applications on systems that either do not support fork(), or have no memory (nor need) to run the master/worker model. It is based on Rainbows! (which is based on Unicorn (which is based on Mongrel)) and inherits parts of each. Zbatery supports your choice of all the thread/fiber/event/actor-based concurrency models and Rack middleware that Rainbows! supports (or will ever support) in a single process. Zbatery will still exploit certain features of Unix for transparent upgrades, log reopening, and graceful stops, but does not rely on them for basic functionality.<p><strong>Changes:</strong> This release syncs up with the latest code from Rainbows! 1.0.x and Unicorn 2.0.x and includes minor bugfixes from both.</p>

myparse is a low-resource database-oriented PHP framework. It aims to be easy for everyone use, update, modify, and extend. The working code base is less than 30 KB, and sites typically use around 400-700 KB of RAM. It is designed to work on shared hosting sites like DreamHost and GoDaddy. It supports full-page file-based caching, sitemap generation, Google Analytics integration, quick MySQL environment switching, and many of the newer mysqli functions. The template system allows users and developers to define their own 'parsed' variables. Installation software is similar, if not easier, than WordPress.<p><strong>Changes:</strong> cachemap, mp_env, and mp_pagination plugins were added. A block_options field and option processing were added.	Emergency MySQL failure cache fallback was added for when a MySQL server is not available and caching is enabled - the old version will be served. The .htaccess file was improved. The table structure was simplified and optimized, with new 'enum' field types that make block/template creation easier. URL and proper 404 reporting was fixed along with multi-query functionality. Debug information was added to help with improper installations and URL errors.

Unicorn is a Unix and LAN/localhost-optimized fork of the Mongrel HTTP server. It is takes full advantage of functionality exclusive to Unix-like operating systems. It will reap and restart workers that die from broken apps, and there is no need to manage multiple processes yourself. Load balancing is done entirely by the operating system kernel. Requests never pile up behind a busy worker.

It also supports atomic log cycling, nginx-style binary re-execution without losing connections, before_fork and after_fork hooks, and optional copy-on-write-friendly memory management.<p><strong>Changes:</strong> This maintenance release fixes several long-standing but recently-noticed bugs.

Publimark is a command line tool to secretly embed
text in an audio file (i.e. audio steganography). Like cryptography, it uses a pair of keys: the public one can be shared, whereas the private one must be kept secret. Anybody can send a steganographic message, but only the private key owner will be able to read it. Of course, marked audio files are still playable without any noticeable change.<p><strong>Changes:</strong> Publimark is now compatible with Botan 1.8 APIs. It also features a brand new and much more secure random generator.</p>

white_dune is a graphical VRML97/X3DV editor, simple NURBS/Superformula 3D modeller, animation tool, and a very limited VRML97/X3DV commandline compiler in development. VRML97 (Virtual Reality Modeling Language) is the ISO standard for displaying 3D data over the Web via browser plugins (&amp;quot;HTML for realtime 3D&amp;quot;). X3DV is the direct successor of VRML97. VRML97 and X3DV have support for animation, real-time interaction, and multimedia (images, movies, and sounds). white_dune can read, create, and display VRML97/X3DV files and let the user change the scenegraph/fields. It also has support for stereoscopic view via &amp;quot;quadbuffer&amp;quot;-capable stereo visuals, and support for 3D input devices like a joystick, spaceball, or magnetic tracker.<p><strong>Changes:</strong> Support for all X3D(V) ISO/IEC 19775-1:2008/ISO/IEC 19776-2 nodes (but a lot of them
are not rendered yet in the 3d
preview window). Static export to Sun wonderland 0.5 Java source. Support for Extensions for 
the cover/covise immersive VRML renderer and the kambi X3D game engine. Italian documentation and (not really complete) menu translation. Icons, menus, and dialogs have been rearranged to support machines with an 800x600 display. AC3Db. ldraw and catt 8 file export. Bugfixes and some usage improvements.</p><p><a href=\"http://freshmeat.net/projects/whitedune\"><img alt=\"Ed35309e684cc6e5c4b48f2d6ed97532_thumb\" src=\"http://freshmeat.net/screenshots/ed/35/ed35309e684cc6e5c4b48f2d6ed97532_thumb.jpg?1237047009\" /></a></p>

Finnix is a small, self-contained, bootable Linux
CD distribution (&amp;quot;LiveCD&amp;quot;) for system
administrators, based on Debian testing.
You can use it to mount and manipulate hard drives
and partitions, monitor networks, rebuild boot
records, install other operating systems, and much
more.
<p><strong>Changes:</strong> This release includes updated upstream Debian software and Linux kernel 2.6.32. The finnix-thumbdrive utility has been removed in favor of UNetbootin, which can take a Finnix ISO and extract it to a bootable USB drive without needing to boot Finnix first. PowerPC support has been officially dropped, though future PowerPC releases may be made on a one-off basis.

LRZIP is a compression program that can achieve very high compression ratios and speed when used with large files. It uses the combined compression algorithms of zpaq and lzma for maximum compression, lzo for maximum speed, and the long range redundancy reduction of rzip. It is designed to scale with increases with RAM size, improving compression further. A choice of either size or speed optimizations allows for either better compression than even lzma can provide, or better speed than gzip, but with bzip2 sized compression levels.<p><strong>Changes:</strong> A minor fix for installing when DESTDIR is set.</p>

RabbIt is a mutating, caching Web proxy used to
speed up surfing over slow links like modems. It
does this by removing advertising and background
images and scaling down images to low quality
JPEGs. RabbIT is written in Java and should be
able to run on any platform. It does depend upon
an image converter if image scaling is on. The
recommended image converter is &amp;quot;convert&amp;quot; from the
ImageMagick package.<p><strong>Changes:</strong> This release adds support for HTTP filtering of connect requests. It fixes a problem in repacking already compressed pages. It handles semi-transparent images better when using the Java-based image converter. It adds more information to the SSL logs.</p>
