Doing good social-scientific research involves bringing together a variety of different skills. There's a lot of writing and rewriting, with all that goes along with that. There is data to manage, clean, and analyze. There's code to be written and maintained. You're learning from and contributing to some field, so there's a whole apparatus of citation and referencing for that. And, ideally, what you're doing should be clear and reproducible both for your own sake, when you come back to it later, and the sake of collaborators, reviewers, and colleagues. How do you do all of that well? Available models prioritize different things. Many useful tricks and tools aren't taught formally at all. For me, the core tension is this. On the one hand, there are strong payoffs to having things organized simply, reliably, and effectively. Good software can help tremendously with this. On the other hand, though, it's obvious that there isn't just one best way (or one platform, toolchain, or whatever) to do it. Moreover, the people who do great work are often the ones who just shut up and play their guitar, so to speak. So it can be tricky to figure out when stopping to think about \"the setup\" is helpful, and when it's just an invitation to waste your increasingly precious time installing something that's likely to break something else in an effort to distract yourself. In practice I am only weakly able to manage this problem.") (p nil "I try to keep as much as possible in plain text. I track most of my writing and all data projects with " (a ((href .

Apart from the many benefits of using good version control, I like the routine of change-commit-push and the feeling that comes with it of having made a little progress. I do most of my writing and all of my data analysis in " (a ((href . "http://emacsformacosx.com/") (title . "Mac builds of Emacs."))

Inevitably, I have tailored Emacs to suit myself. Thanks to the recent revival of interest in Emacs amongst a younger generation of coders, managing this configuration is much more rational than it once was. I use a modified version of Eric Schulte's " (a ((href . "http://eschulte.github.com/emacs-starter-kit/") (title . "A collection of sane Emacs defaults."))

More complex documents - scholarly papers, reports detailing data analyses, notional book manuscripts - tend to exceed the limits of what Markdown or its more tricked-out relations can comfortably handle. The biggest stumbling block is the tedious but necessary scholarly machinery of citations and bibliographies. In practice is hard to deal with that using a lightweight markup format. (This is partly the fault of inefficient citation conventions in the fields I work in, but I can do little to change those.)  There are various possibilities out there, but I find they're either too limited or threaten to turn back into something more ungainly than weightier alternatives, which defeats the purpose.

I wrote my Ph.D and a book that way, so the sunk costs of long use make it very easy to use. I manage bibliographical databases in Emacs using ordinary /.bib / files and git.

We have a worldwide communications and distribution network where you can publish anything you want and -- if you can manage to get anybody's attention -- get near-instant feedback. Writers just 20 years ago would have " (em nil "killed") " for that kind of feedback loop. Killed! And you're asking me what word processor I use? Just fucking write, then publish, then write some more. One day your writing will get featured on a site like Reddit and you'll go from 5 readers to 5000 in a matter of hours, and they'll all tell you how much your writing sucks. And most of them will be right! Learn how to respond to constructive criticism and filter out the trolls, and you can write the next great American novel in edlin.") (p nil "People then ask what format I use to write my books. That's a more interesting question. It's still completely orthogonal to becoming a better writer, but I'm a text wonk, so I'll tell you. I wrote the original " (a ((href . "http://diveintopython.org/") (title . "Mark's Python guide.")) "Dive Into Python") " in " (a ((href . "http://www.docbook.org/") (title .

"http://feedparser.org/docs/") (title . "The docs for the feed parser.")) "documentation for Universal Feed Parser") ", all in DocBook. I self-published \"Dive Into Python\" in HTML, PDF, Word, and plain text. For years, there they sat, a list of downloads in different formats. Then I looked at my logs and realized that very few people ever downloaded it at all, and those that did mostly downloaded the HTML version. This was an epiphany. I publish my work in HTML, people primarily read my work in HTML, so " (a ((href . "http://diveintomark.org/archives/2009/03/27/dive-into-history-2009-edition") (title . "Mark's article on writing in HTML.")) "it makes sense to write in HTML") " too. Writing in one format and converting it to HTML is not worth the mental and technical overhead. HTML is not just one output format among many; it is " (em nil "the") " format of our age. This epiphany was one of the reasons I got involved in HTML5.") (p nil (a ((href .

"Mark's HTML5 guide.")) "Dive Into HTML5") ", is also written in HTML, and my editor tells me that they will handle the nasty business of converting it into suitable formats for print. This may become a factor in choosing a publisher for future books: the ability to avoid Microsoft Word altogether.") (h3 nil "What would be your dream setup?") (p nil "I have an Apple ][e in my attic. My parents bought it in 1984. We used it exclusively for five years; I wrote my first program on it, I wrote my first poem on it, my mother ran her first business on it. We sold it to a family friend in 1989, and she used it as her primary computer for 10 more years, until 1999. A few years ago, I paid her to ship it back to me. The damn thing still works -- color monitor, 80-column card, original disk drives, everything. Most of my 25-year-old 5.25-inch floppy disks still work. Of course there's no software being written for it anymore (except " (a ((href . "http://webpages.milwpc.com/finkjc/silverncastle/") (title . "An RPG for the Apple II.")) "Silvern Castle") ", God bless you), but what it could do in 1984, it can still do just as well in 2009.") (p nil "I've had my current desktop for a little over two years. I want to continue using it for another 20. I mean that literally: this computer, this keyboard, this mouse, these three monitors. 20 years. There's no technical reason the hardware can't last that long, so it's a matter of whether there will be useful software to run on it. First, there's the operating system. People throw away computers every day because they're \"too slow\" to run the latest version of their preferred operating system. Linux (and open source in general) is not immune to this, but I think it's more immune than proprietary operating systems. Debian only recently dropped official support for Motorola 68K machines; that's stuff like the Mac IIci that I bought off the clearance rack at Microcenter in 1992. The latest version of Debian still runs on my old PowerPC \"G4\" Apple laptop, even though the latest version of Apple's operating system doesn't. Commercial vendors have a vested interest in upgrading you to the latest and greatest; supporting the old stuff is unglamorous and expensive. Commercial open source vendors aren't really much better than commercial proprietary vendors in this regard, but community-led Linux distributions can afford to have different priorities.") (p nil "Next in the software stack is drivers. Everything from the network card to the graphics card to the sound card needs a working driver. Linux has the most comprehensive driver support of any operating system, ever. Yes, I'm including Windows in that statement. People think Linux driver support sucks because newer hardware sometimes only works with proprietary Windows drivers. That's true, but there's a lot more old hardware in the world than new hardware, and Linux has superior support for older hardware because the community writes and maintains their own drivers. People throw away computer accessories every day because they upgrade their operating system and can't find functioning drivers. (Will that scanner you bought in 1999 still work on your shiny new 64-bit Windows 7 machine? I wouldn't bet on it.) All of my hardware is supported today by open source drivers, which removes one of the primary reasons that people throw away working hardware. Again, I'm not saying Linux never drops support for older hardware, but the cycle is longer and the incentives are different.") (p nil "Next up is applications. Open source has the clear advantage here, because communities can recompile and redistribute other people's software for multiple platforms. I'm currently running a 64-bit operating system on 64-bit hardware. With few exceptions, all of the software I run can also be recompiled to run on 32-bit operating systems. This is so common now that we take it for granted, but it's really quite remarkable. No doubt there will soon be 128-bit hardware available at reasonable prices, and then other advances after that. And Linux distributions will take advantage of newer hardware, but they can also continue supporting older hardware for much longer than proprietary operating system vendors, which rely on individual developers to support each platform. So if there's an operating system that still runs on my hardware 20 years from now, I'm pretty sure I'll be able to run Emacs on top of it.") (p nil "Where my 20-year plan will most likely fail is not at the operating system or driver level, nor with the existing crop of applications. At some point we will invent an entirely new class of application, like the web browser was an entirely new class of application 20 years ago. This new class of application will naturally be targeted at the \"current\" hardware of the day, and nobody will bother to backport it to the hardware I have now. Chromium is actually a good example of this, only shifted a few years. It contains a dynamic JavaScript compiler (V8) which requires explicit support for each hardware architecture. There is no Chromium for PowerPC, even though it's open source, because a central piece of the application only works on x86 and AMD64 architectures. There's nothing stopping anyone from writing a PowerPC version of V8, but it's unlikely to happen unless some super-genius hobbyist decides to take it on. And browsing the web and using web-based \"applications\" accounts for 90% of the time I spend in front of a computer. (Writing doesn't actually take that long. It's the long stretches of procrastinating that take up most of your time.) So it's a safe bet that in the next 20 years, there will be an entirely new class of application that doesn't exist now, and I'll want to use it, and my hardware will be so far behind the curve that none of those new applications will support it. Then I'll have to upgrade.") (p nil "But hey, you asked for my dream setup. That's it: one computer for 20 years."))))) (entry nil (title nil "Richard Stallman") (link ((href .

Doing good social-scientific research involves bringing together a variety of different skills. There's a lot of writing and rewriting, with all that goes along with that. There is data to manage, clean, and analyze. There's code to be written and maintained. You're learning from and contributing to some field, so there's a whole apparatus of citation and referencing for that. And, ideally, what you're doing should be clear and reproducible both for your own sake, when you come back to it later, and the sake of collaborators, reviewers, and colleagues. How do you do all of that well? Available models prioritize different things. Many useful tricks and tools aren't taught formally at all. For me, the core tension is this. On the one hand, there are strong payoffs to having things organized simply, reliably, and effectively. Good software can help tremendously with this. On the other hand, though, it's obvious that there isn't just one best way (or one platform, toolchain, or whatever) to do it. Moreover, the people who do great work are often the ones who just shut up and play their guitar, so to speak. So it can be tricky to figure out when stopping to think about \\\"the setup\\\" is helpful, and when it's just an invitation to waste your increasingly precious time installing something that's likely to break something else in an effort to distract yourself. In practice I am only weakly able to manage this problem.\") (p nil \"I try to keep as much as possible in plain text.

Apart from the many benefits of using good version control, I like the routine of change-commit-push and the feeling that comes with it of having made a little progress.

Inevitably, I have tailored Emacs to suit myself.

Doing good social-scientific research involves bringing together a variety of different skills. There's a lot of writing and rewriting, with all that goes along with that. There is data to manage, clean, and analyze. There's code to be written and maintained. You're learning from and contributing to some field, so there's a whole apparatus of citation and referencing for that. And, ideally, what you're doing should be clear and reproducible both for your own sake, when you come back to it later, and the sake of collaborators, reviewers, and colleagues. How do you do all of that well? Available models prioritize different things. Many useful tricks and tools aren't taught formally at all. For me, the core tension is this. On the one hand, there are strong payoffs to having things organized simply, reliably, and effectively. Good software can help tremendously with this. On the other hand, though, it's obvious that there isn't just one best way (or one platform, toolchain, or whatever) to do it. Moreover, the people who do great work are often the ones who just shut up and play their guitar, so to speak. So it can be tricky to figure out when stopping to think about \"the setup\" is helpful, and when it's just an invitation to waste your increasingly precious time installing something that's likely to break something else in an effort to distract yourself.

I think UI “candy” takes up precious computing resources that I prefer to devote to my CAD tools, so I like to run a no-frills UI.

My parents bought it in 1984. We used it exclusively for five years; I wrote my first program on it, I wrote my first poem on it, my mother ran her first business on it. We sold it to a family friend in 1989, and she used it as her primary computer for 10 more years, until 1999. A few years ago, I paid her to ship it back to me. The damn thing still works -- color monitor, 80-column card, original disk drives, everything. Most of my 25-year-old 5.25-inch floppy disks still work. Of course there's no software being written for it anymore (except \" (a ((href . \"http://webpages.milwpc.com/finkjc/silverncastle/\") (title . \"An RPG for the Apple II.\")) \"Silvern Castle\") \", God bless you), but what it could do in 1984, it can still do just as well in 2009.\") (p nil \"I've had my current desktop for a little over two years. I want to continue using it for another 20. I mean that literally: this computer, this keyboard, this mouse, these three monitors. 20 years. There's no technical reason the hardware can't last that long, so it's a matter of whether there will be useful software to run on it. First, there's the operating system. People throw away computers every day because they're \\\"too slow\\\" to run the latest version of their preferred operating system. Linux (and open source in general) is not immune to this, but I think it's more immune than proprietary operating systems. Debian only recently dropped official support for Motorola 68K machines; that's stuff like the Mac IIci that I bought off the clearance rack at Microcenter in 1992. The latest version of Debian still runs on my old PowerPC \\\"G4\\\" Apple laptop, even though the latest version of Apple's operating system doesn't. Commercial vendors have a vested interest in upgrading you to the latest and greatest; supporting the old stuff is unglamorous and expensive. Commercial open source vendors aren't really much better than commercial proprietary vendors in this regard, but community-led Linux distributions can afford to have different priorities.\") (p nil \"Next in the software stack is drivers. Everything from the network card to the graphics card to the sound card needs a working driver. Linux has the most comprehensive driver support of any operating system, ever. Yes, I'm including Windows in that statement. People think Linux driver support sucks because newer hardware sometimes only works with proprietary Windows drivers. That's true, but there's a lot more old hardware in the world than new hardware, and Linux has superior support for older hardware because the community writes and maintains their own drivers. People throw away computer accessories every day because they upgrade their operating system and can't find functioning drivers. (Will that scanner you bought in 1999 still work on your shiny new 64-bit Windows 7 machine? I wouldn't bet on it.) All of my hardware is supported today by open source drivers, which removes one of the primary reasons that people throw away working hardware. Again, I'm not saying Linux never drops support for older hardware, but the cycle is longer and the incentives are different.\") (p nil \"Next up is applications. Open source has the clear advantage here, because communities can recompile and redistribute other people's software for multiple platforms. I'm currently running a 64-bit operating system on 64-bit hardware. With few exceptions, all of the software I run can also be recompiled to run on 32-bit operating systems. This is so common now that we take it for granted, but it's really quite remarkable. No doubt there will soon be 128-bit hardware available at reasonable prices, and then other advances after that. And Linux distributions will take advantage of newer hardware, but they can also continue supporting older hardware for much longer than proprietary operating system vendors, which rely on individual developers to support each platform. So if there's an operating system that still runs on my hardware 20 years from now, I'm pretty sure I'll be able to run Emacs on top of it.\") (p nil \"Where my 20-year plan will most likely fail is not at the operating system or driver level, nor with the existing crop of applications. At some point we will invent an entirely new class of application, like the web browser was an entirely new class of application 20 years ago. This new class of application will naturally be targeted at the \\\"current\\\" hardware of the day, and nobody will bother to backport it to the hardware I have now. Chromium is actually a good example of this, only shifted a few years. It contains a dynamic JavaScript compiler (V8) which requires explicit support for each hardware architecture. There is no Chromium for PowerPC, even though it's open source, because a central piece of the application only works on x86 and AMD64 architectures. There's nothing stopping anyone from writing a PowerPC version of V8, but it's unlikely to happen unless some super-genius hobbyist decides to take it on. And browsing the web and using web-based \\\"applications\\\" accounts for 90% of the time I spend in front of a computer. (Writing doesn't actually take that long. It's the long stretches of procrastinating that take up most of your time.) So it's a safe bet that in the next 20 years, there will be an entirely new class of application that doesn't exist now, and I'll want to use it, and my hardware will be so far behind the curve that none of those new applications will support it. Then I'll have to upgrade.\") (p nil \"But hey, you asked for my dream setup.
