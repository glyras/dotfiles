So do not hesitate and check it out now:<br /><a href=\"http://mobile.frictionalgames.com/\">http://mobile.frictionalgames.com/</a><br /><br />In case you have already played both Amnesia and Penumbra, here are some more more recommendations:<br /><br /><a href=\"http://ifdb.tads.org/viewgame?id=op0uw1gn1tjqmjt7\">Anchorhead</a><br />A lovecraftian Interactive Fiction game with story similar to \"Shadow of Innsmouth\" and \"The Case of Charles Dexter Ward\". It is quite long and very well written and implemented. If you can manage playing without graphics this is a great choice.<br /><br /><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Call_of_Cthulhu:_Dark_Corners_of_the_Earth\">Call of Cthulhu: Dark Corners of the Earth</a><br />Another lovecraft-game, but this time in glorious realtime 3D. Especially the first third of the game is deliciously creepy with a nice foreboding atmosphere. If you can stand a few bugs and cheap deaths, this game is well worth getting.<br /><br /><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I_Have_No_Mouth,_and_I_Must_Scream_%28video_game%29\">I have no mouth and I must scream</a><br />This is a game that is not that scary, but instead features some extremely disturbing themes. The story takes place in a post apocalyptic future, where the last five people on earth are being tortured by a not-so-friendly AI named AM. It plays like a usual point-and-click but with some fun twists. Unfortunately the game suffers from some annoying puzzle design, but is still worth trying out. And oh, the game works with <a href=\"http://www.scummvm.org/\">ScummVM</a>, and should thus run on just about any platform.<br /><br /><br /><div style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style=\"font-size:180%;\"><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">What to watch?</span></span><br /></div><a href=\"http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_QfesHslH-uc/TMquCDo0VEI/AAAAAAAAAQM/LuT164yodEg/s1600/lost-highway-2.jpg\"><img style=\"display: block; margin: 0px auto 10px; text-align: center; cursor: pointer; width: 295px; height: 189px;\" src=\"http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_QfesHslH-uc/TMquCDo0VEI/AAAAAAAAAQM/LuT164yodEg/s400/lost-highway-2.jpg\" alt=\"\" id=\"BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5533426442537555010\" border=\"0\" /></a>At Halloween all kinds of crappy horror movies are released, so to save you from that here are some films that you might have missed:<br /><br /><a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1016301/\">Fermat's Room</a><br />Five people are called to a puzzle evening which takes on a diabolical twist. If you enjoyed limited location based movies like Cube and (first) Saw, this is one is highly recommended!<br /><br /><a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1020530/\">Eden Lake</a><br />A story about a couple taking a trip to a lake is not all that original, but Eden Lake has a nice twist to it. Beware of some disturbing scenes.<br /><br /><a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0424136/\">Hard Candy</a><br />Cranking up the disturb-o-meter, this movie is unsettling to say the least. It starts out with a creepy meeting between a man and a young girl, and then gets progressively worse.<br /><br /><a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0112922/\">Day of the Beast</a><br />To lighten up after Hard candy, you should consider this movie. It is about a priest that in order to stop the anti-christ decides to become evil. He teams up with a mentally unstable death-metal fan to do so. Hilarity ensues.<br /><br /><a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0116922/\">Lost Highway</a><br />This is probably my favorite a Lynch movie, if only for an excellent scene involving a telephone at a party. It is not that scary, but keeps a brooding atmosphere throughout. Beware of weird lynchian plot!<br /><br /><a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0235198/\">Audition</a><br />Since we want to go out with  a bang I am rounding up the list with this disturbing masterpiece. The movie is quite slow, but this only helps building to moments of true horror that it has. The end scene is unforgettable.<br /><br /><br /><div style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style=\"font-size:180%;\"><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">What to read?</span></span><br /></div><a href=\"http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_QfesHslH-uc/TMquOfdzwFI/AAAAAAAAAQc/yyEdubEicDk/s1600/n170060.jpg\"><img style=\"display: block; margin: 0px auto 10px; text-align: center; cursor: pointer; width: 270px; height: 257px;\" src=\"http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_QfesHslH-uc/TMquOfdzwFI/AAAAAAAAAQc/yyEdubEicDk/s400/n170060.jpg\" alt=\"\" id=\"BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5533426656166002770\" border=\"0\" /></a>Nothing can tingle the imagination as a good book. So here are some tips on how to invoke those nightmares I bet you long for.<br /><br /><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H._P._Lovecraft_bibliography\">Anything Lovecraft</a><br />A novel by the master of horror is a must! For people new to the man, I would recommend \"The Whisperer in the Darkness\", \"The Shadow over Innsmouth\" or \"The Dunwhich horror\", all very typical lovecraftian tales. All of his works is <a href=\"http://www.dagonbytes.com/thelibrary/lovecraft/\">available online</a>, but they are of course best enjoyed in front of the fireplace.<br /><br /><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Terror_%28novel%29\">The Terror</a><br />A retelling of the doomed Franklin expedition with the addition of a stalking monster. Most of the book is based on true events, and the supernatural spice increase scariness in an already horrific story. This is probably one of the best horror books I have read. It takes a while to get into, but when you do the book will not let you go.<br /><br /><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perdido_Street_Station\">Perdido Street Station</a><br />I consider the books author, China Mieville, but be a kind of modern day Lovecraft. He has the same dense, but yet enthralling, prose and an incredible ability of making monsters. The books takes place in a fantasy world, but even though it is very weird, it feels in real in a way. Prepare for some really disturbing imagery.<br /><br /><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stiff:_The_Curious_Lives_of_Human_Cadavers\">Stiff: The Curious Lives of Human Cadavers</a><br />Ever wondered what happens to human bodies after they die? This book contains all you want to know and then some. It opens up with describing rows of heads lying in bowls (to be used in educational purpose) and then gets worse.

"html")) "<span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">Introduction</span><br />After writing the <a href=\"http://frictionalgames.blogspot.com/2010/10/tech-feature-pre-pass-lighting.html\">previous post</a> on pre-pass lighting I started doing some tests, to see how it compares to the old deferred renderer. The results that I got where pretty interesting, so thought I might as well share them. Also note that this post might be a bit more technical than the previous.<br /><br />The good thing with these renderers is that they both share the basic material data. So I can use the same data for both HPl2 and HPl3. HPL3 comes with the few more features for decals but for tests, it is easy to just skip them.  When setting up the test I went with a very simple scene, it just the same box model rendered several times, a floor and lights. Some times it is best to test with proper game scenes, but I wanted to something that could be easily tweaked and gave simpler output. This means that the tests are not 100% accurate of in-game performance, but even testing a level in game is not that, as framerate varies a lot depending on where in a level one looks. So usually benchmarking has some kind of fly-through, but that is of the scope from what I intended to do.<br /><br />Note that HPl2 test was built in Visual Studio 2003, while HPL3 uses the 2010 version. I do not think this should matter much though, even if the optimization routines differ, simply because pretty much all of the work is done on the GPU. The graphics card I did all my testing on is a Radeon 5850 HD (and others where tried for some tests). And as a final note, all of the data is given as average frame time (in milliseconds!) and not as frames per second. As <a href=\"http://www.humus.name/index.php?page=News&amp;ID=279\">Emil Persson points out</a>, FPS is not a very good way to compare performance.<br /><br /><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">Test #1</span><br />Now with my setup details out of the way, let's get down to the details. I first started out with a scene like this:<br /><a href=\"http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_QfesHslH-uc/TMGdg-Sx6II/AAAAAAAAAQE/3gqFaULPqw4/s1600/Screen_Simple3D_000.jpg\"><img style=\"display: block; margin: 0px auto 10px; text-align: center; cursor: pointer; width: 260px; height: 196px;\" src=\"http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_QfesHslH-uc/TMGdg-Sx6II/AAAAAAAAAQE/3gqFaULPqw4/s400/Screen_Simple3D_000.jpg\" alt=\"\" id=\"BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5530875007190820994\" border=\"0\" /></a><span style=\"font-style: italic;\">1 x box, xz-plane floor, 1x spot light + shadow</span><br />which game me the following results:<br />HPL2: 0.78ms<br />HPL3: 0.84ms<br />Difference: +7.7%<br />This means, that given a simple scene like this the old renderer is actually faster! This is not that strange though since the scene does not have many lit screen pixels, most of the image being sky. Thus, the extra pass extra made with the pre-pass renderer matters more than an lighting speed-ups. Also, the decrease in draw buffer (3 to 2) in the g-buffer does not make up for the extra pass.<br /><br /><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">Test #2</span><br /><span style=\"font-style: italic;\">4000 x boxes, 1 x point light, x-z plane floor</span><br />HPL2: 14.9  <br />HPL3: 18.5<br />Difference: +24%<br />As expected when there is a lot of things to render, the pre-pass lighting is even slower. That extra pass shows on the performance. Remember though that 4000 objects is quite much and an important thing for good performance on GPUs is to have as few draw calls as possible.<br /><br /><br /><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">Test #3</span><br /><span style=\"font-style: italic;\">1 x boxes, 1000 x point light, x-z plane floor</span><br />HPL2: 30.0<br />HPL3: 29.2<br />Difference: -2.7%<br />As noticed, once the scene is filled with lights, pre-pass lighting is faster, but only so by a slight amount. Especially considering the large amount of lights. (I later realised that the actual lit screen pixels where quite few, something fixed later on in test #5).<br /><br /><br /><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">Test #4</span><br /><span style=\"font-style: italic;\">4000 x boxes, 1000 x point light, x-z plane floor</span><br />HPL2: 47.5<br />HPL3: 52.0<br />Difference: +10%<br />Doing a really stressful test (the number of lights and objects are really large) it seems like the old deferred renderer wins out. This was actually a bit unexpected and dissappointing to me as I thought that the pre-pass lighting should not be this far behind. But taking the little difference in test 3 into account, it is not that suprising. Still, after these tests it is clearly shown that pre-pass lighting is far from a giant speed up compared to deferred shading and it actually seems slower in most cases.<br /><br />I also tried to skip the early-z pass for pre-pass lighting (I use early-z in both renderers on all other tests). This is basically a pass where the z-buffer is set up, and makes sure later passes only draws visible pixels. From reading Crytech papers, it does not seem like the the Crysis 2 engine has this though (and same seems true for other engines), so I tried to do a quick and dirty test of not using it and got this data: 48.7 (+2.5%)<br />This means that even without the early z test, the pre-pass was still slower. However, I did not attempts to reduce overdraw (like sorting front to back) and it might be possible for optimizations here. However, when rendering front to back, there will be a lot more state switching as you cannot sort according to texture, etc as efficiently, so I wonder if the data might not even be worse in a more realistic scenario.<br /><br />I also tried this test out on a few other other cards (again with full early-z testing):<br />Geforce 240gt:  125, 137 (+9.6%)<br />Geforce 320M:  240, 240 (+/- 0%)<br />This gave the indication that on some cards pre-pass might actually be better, and that it might not be as clear-cut as the first tests seemed to show.<br /><br />As a final variation on this test, I added illumination maps to all textures, a feature that requires an extra pass in the old engine. I also removed the height map rendering. This gave me: 50.6, 50.0 (-1.2%)<br />This is a very tiny speed up considering that the methods now have the same amount of passes and that pre-pass lighting has faster light rendering and a smaller g-buffer.<br /><br /><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">Test #5</span><br /><span style=\"font-style: italic;\">488 x boxes, 30 x point light, x-z plane floor</span><br />Radeon 5850 HD:  7.4, 7.8 (+5.4%)<br />Geforce 240gt: 18, 19 (+5.5%)<br />Geforce 320M: 50.0, 45.5 (-9%)<br />Geforce 9800gtx: 9.5, 9.5 (0%)<br /><br />In this test I change to a more realistic number of lights and draw calls. I also aligned the lights so the lit pixels covered the entire screen, which I did not do above. As can be seen, on my computer (the 5850) deferred shading still wins, but on a less powerful card the pre-pass lighting is much faster. This difference might be a bandwidth issue and some cards might have problems pushing the data amounts required for deferred shading.<br /><br />I also did a tweak to this test and turned down the number of draw calls a bit:<br /><span style=\"font-style: italic;\">316x boxes, 30 x point light, x-z plane floor</span><br />Giving: 6.4, 6.6 (+3%)<br />This further reduced the difference and if I did the hackish removal of early z, pre-pass lighting plunged down to: 5,2 (-18%)<br />Even though this removal of early z is not very realistic, the results show that I need to investigate it. Something I will do once I get a more proper scene up and running.<br /><br />Finally, I also tried to give all the boxes illumination (and turning back on early z test):<br />6.8, 6.6 (-2.9%)<br />This clearly shows how you get the illumination almost for free in pre-pass, and that it costs a bit more with the deferred shader. This is not surprising though, given that it requires an extra pass, but hints that further effects can be more efficiently implemented when using pre-pass lighting.<br /><br /><br /><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">Conclusions</span><br />The tests clearly show that my previous assumption that light rendering in pre-pass lighting would be much faster was incorrect. It is a bit faster, but only noticeable so when really stretching the limit and then only by a small fraction. This makes me conclude that one should not use pre-pass lighting to have faster light rendering. However, as can be seen on the test with the Geforce 320M, the pre-pass lighting technique matters a lot more on older hardware, and it might actually be of greater use there.<br /><br />There is not any vast differences in the techniques though and instead the choice should be based on other merits. Given that pre-pass lighting allows for so much more variety in materials, I will keep it for HPL3, but I will not be expecting any rises in framerate anymore.<br /><br />I hope this post will prove useful for those who are thinking of using either rendering method, and for the rest it might be an interesting insight on how testing is done (at least how I do it). Again, sorry for the lack of pretty picture, which I promise to make up for!<div class=\"blogger-post-footer\"><img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/9193968969153274146-2465634771152064491?l=frictionalgames.blogspot.com' alt='' /></div>") (link ((rel .

"text")) "Tech Feature: Pre-pass lighting") (content ((type . "html")) "Progress on the new engine, HPL3, is coming along nicely and recently I changed the core rendering system into something called Pre-pass lighting. This switch has been made for a number of reasons, but before I got into that and what pre-pass lighting exactly is, I need to explain how we did it back in the \"old days\".<br /><br /><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">Forward Rendering</span><br />The engine powering Penumbra (HPL1) uses something called forward rendering. This type of rendering works by rendering the entire scene on an object basis. So when rendering a chair, wall, or any geometry in the world, this was done by drawing it one time for every light that touches it. So an object that is lit by three lights has to be drawn three times, and so on. This technique can be quite limiting when setting up scenes as you need to be very careful when adding lights. It might not actually be clear exactly how much impact on performance a single light will have and levels usually require quite some tweaking to get right. The complexity of a scene can be expressed as:<br /><span style=\"font-style: italic;\"><br />Draw calls = Objects * Lights</span><br /><br />This means that the number of draw calls can easily get very large and only adding a single light, even if it has little effect on the scene visually, can have very negative effects on performance.<br /><br /><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">Deferred Shading</span><br />When starting work on HPL2 (which was used for Amnesia) I wanted to get away from this annoying light limitations. Since HPL1 had been created a new technique called \"Deferred shading\" had emerged and when work on HPl2 was started, the average PC system was up for the the task.<br /><br />What makes deferred shading special is that it separates rendering objects and rendering the lighting. This works by first rendering to a special G-buffer that contains information such as normals, depth and color of all on screen objects.  The final output looks like this:<br /><br /><a href=\"http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_QfesHslH-uc/TMAHeDduksI/AAAAAAAAAPs/M8i7J6UDJxE/s1600/deferred_gbuffer.jpg\"><img style=\"display: block; margin: 0px auto 10px; text-align: center; cursor: pointer; width: 518px; height: 130px;\" src=\"http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_QfesHslH-uc/TMAHeDduksI/AAAAAAAAAPs/M8i7J6UDJxE/s400/deferred_gbuffer.jpg\" alt=\"\" id=\"BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5530428555318432450\" border=\"0\" /></a><br />From left to right: Color, normals and depth. Note that these texture have 4 channels each and not visible are also saved specular intensity and power. These three texture then represent the properties of all visible data. It is then used by the lights to render the final image. This makes the complexity of the rendering:<br /><br /><span style=\"font-style: italic;\">Draw calls = Objects + Lights</span><br /><br />This is a lot nicer and as lights and objects are separated, it is a lot easier to add lights to a scene without worrying about performance hits. It is also much simpler to intuitively  understand how performance will be affected. By using this technique we where able to use a lot more light sources in Amnesia and considering all of the dynamic lights needed for the mechanics, the game would have been a lot harder to make using forward rendering<span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">.<br /><br /></span>Deferred rendering is not without problems though. First of all, rendering the G-buffer means rendering to three textures at one time which is quite performance heavy, meaning a scene with few lights runs faster on a forward renderer. Secondly, there is no support for fullscreen anti-aliasing either, and one has to do some hackish tricks to remove jagged edges (the \"edge smooth\" feature in Amnesia). Finally, there is much less material variety possible as every property needed to generate the final image needs to be in the G-buffer. Since we could mange without fancy skin shaders in Amnesia, it was turned out to not be too much of a problem though.<br /><br /><a href=\"http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_QfesHslH-uc/TMA1onUtaXI/AAAAAAAAAP0/p08--IzATRM/s1600/agrippa_main_lights.jpg\"><img style=\"display: block; margin: 0px auto 10px; text-align: center; cursor: pointer; width: 400px; height: 286px;\" src=\"http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_QfesHslH-uc/TMA1onUtaXI/AAAAAAAAAP0/p08--IzATRM/s400/agrippa_main_lights.jpg\" alt=\"\" id=\"BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5530479314277853554\" border=\"0\" /></a>Scenes like the test of Agrippa above would not be possible in our old Renderer. In this test shot around 30 lights help light Agrippa in a nice fashion, and since the geometry and lighting is decoupled it is possible to run this with a high framerate.<br /><br /><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\"><br />Pre-pass lighting<br /></span>I heard about this technique (first saw it <a href=\"http://diaryofagraphicsprogrammer.blogspot.com/2008/03/light-pre-pass-renderer.html\">here</a>) during the development of Amnesia and was a bit interested in trying it out. I was interested in the tech back then since it made light rendering go faster, something that had proved a bit of a bottle neck in Amnesia. However, I did not have time back then and decided against it.<br /><br />As I started to update the engine to HPL3 I again looked at this technology. This time more had been written on the subject and it had actually been tested. For example a similar algorithm was used in Insomniac's Reistance 2 and Crytech goes over it in a paper about CryEngine 2. This also meant that the method was practical, and was well worth trying (I usually try and use tech I have been able to try in other games, as tech dead-ends can prove quite expensive).<br /><br />Pre-pass lighting (or deferred lighting as it is called sometimes) is very similar to deferred shading and I could use much of the code from HPl2 when implementing it. Only a few changes in materials and light rendering was really needed. The rendering works by also first rendering to a G-buffer, but one only containing normal, depth and specular power. After that lights are rendered, but they render only part of the light equation; basically color and specular intensity. Then in a final pass all objects are rendered again and the light data from the previous pass is used to render the final image. The sequence is like this:<br /><span style=\"font-style: italic;\"><br />Render Normals+Depth -> Render Lights  -> Render final image</span><br /><br />The first good thing is that this technique is able to render lights faster, since each lights has to do less equations and access less textures. The algorithm also includes an extra step at the end, but this does not matter that much, as the added the final render takes is regained by the one less buffer needed to be rendered to in the first g-buffer pass (only 2 textures needed instead of the 3 deferred shading uses).<br /><br />This speed up was not the main reason why I used it though. Since each object rendered again during the final pass, it is possible to have a much larger variety of material types. Instead of being confined to using what can be fitted into a g-buffer, a material can do specific calculations the final image pass. This allows for specialized skin shaders and other tricks. For example, it is now possible to have more features packed into the decal materials:<br /><br /><a href=\"http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_QfesHslH-uc/TMBL-eUfhnI/AAAAAAAAAP8/GJb3oVRz010/s1600/decal.jpg\"><img style=\"display: block; margin: 0px auto 10px; text-align: center; cursor: pointer; width: 362px; height: 287px;\" src=\"http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_QfesHslH-uc/TMBL-eUfhnI/AAAAAAAAAP8/GJb3oVRz010/s400/decal.jpg\" alt=\"\" id=\"BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5530503879073957490\" border=\"0\" /></a>Above  is a decal with both color, normalmap and height map, something not possible in the previous engine. (Note that color and normal have separate alpha and that the height map make the tiles seem carved out of the ground).<br /><br /><br /><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">End notes</span><br />Now I have given a  little rundown of how the new renderer works and how it differs from the old one. I have skipped a lot of the details and more technical stuff, to make the post a bit shorter. So if you have any questions, comment and I might have some kind of answer!<br /><br />Also, sorry for the lack of new and exciting images in this post. Next tech feature should be more fun on that part, as I am now moving on to <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">Terrain</span>...<br /><br />EDIT:<br />I eventually did some tests on the algorithm and compared it to the old renderer.

"html")) "Now I am pretty much done with the first major feature for HPl3, the engine that will power our upcoming (and so far super secret) game. This feature is global sunlight along with shadows, a feature not implemented previously.  And since it is now implemented you can bet it will an important feature for the secret game ;)<br /><br />First up was making the Ambient light nicer. Below is screenshot of how it looks in HPL2:<br /><a href=\"http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_QfesHslH-uc/TLXWBwY4RII/AAAAAAAAAO0/OYDdXlXkCNA/s1600/bad_ambient.jpg\"><img style=\"display: block; margin: 0px auto 10px; text-align: center; cursor: pointer; width: 400px; height: 300px;\" src=\"http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_QfesHslH-uc/TLXWBwY4RII/AAAAAAAAAO0/OYDdXlXkCNA/s400/bad_ambient.jpg\" alt=\"\" id=\"BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5527559443324617858\" border=\"0\" /></a><br />This is just a uniform color blend that has been added and does not look very. It is quite hard to see any details when there is a uniform texture such as in the screenshot above. To get nice ambient lighting what you need to do is to somehow simulate global illumination. Light does not just hit an object and then stop, but bounces around and scatters color from nearby on each other. There is a lot of research into this and most of it require one to pre-calculate the result in one way or another.<br /><br />I settled with something really simple called hemispherical lighting, which basically mean to have separate up and down (sky and ground)  colors and then blend them depending on the normal of the  surface. My first idea was to use cubemaps to do something similar, but since the cubemap needs to be very blurred, using hemispherical lighting gave pretty much the same result and is a lot faster. Here is the result:<br /><a href=\"http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_QfesHslH-uc/TLXXftw1dRI/AAAAAAAAAO8/vmBfT1BXXNc/s1600/good_ambient.jpg\"><img style=\"display: block; margin: 0px auto 10px; text-align: center; cursor: pointer; width: 400px; height: 300px;\" src=\"http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_QfesHslH-uc/TLXXftw1dRI/AAAAAAAAAO8/vmBfT1BXXNc/s400/good_ambient.jpg\" alt=\"\" id=\"BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5527561057527493906\" border=\"0\" /></a>Now it is a lot easier to see details and looks a lot better.<br /><br />Next up was the direct lighting from the sun and this was quite simple. I could just add some tweak to the existing shaders and make it work. Basically sunlight is just like normal light but without any position or attenuation.  This means every pixel is lit from the same direction and strength is independent of distance to the  source (as it does not have a position).<br /><br />Here is how the scene looks when we add that too:<br /><a href=\"http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_QfesHslH-uc/TLXa1oW740I/AAAAAAAAAPE/Je0pJrchjNY/s1600/amb_and_sun.jpg\"><img style=\"display: block; margin: 0px auto 10px; text-align: center; cursor: pointer; width: 400px; height: 300px;\" src=\"http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_QfesHslH-uc/TLXa1oW740I/AAAAAAAAAPE/Je0pJrchjNY/s400/amb_and_sun.jpg\" alt=\"\" id=\"BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5527564732568691522\" border=\"0\" /></a><br />Much nicer, even though the texture is a bit boring. Note that there now is specular because of the direct light from the sun.<br /><br />Finally, lets move on to the shadows! The engine already feature the basic shadow rendering though a technique called shadow maps. What is the big problem now is to make it look good over long distances. Since shadow mapping works by rendering from the light's point of view, doing shadows from an omnipresent light source gets a bit complicated. The simple solution is to use a really large shadow map, but then you would get very bad resolution near the camera.<br /><br />What you do instead is to use the fact that objects take up smaller space of the screen the farther away they are. So the idea is to use the shadow map in such a way that you give more room for pixel nearby and less to those far away. This is something that has been researched quite a bit and there are various techniques to achieve this. One solution is to warp the projection when rendering to the shadow map. This comes with a lot of issues though and is very rarely used in games.<br /><br />Instead most games use a technique called <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">Cascaded Shadow Maps</span> or <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">Parallel Split Shadow Maps</span>. The way this works is that the view frustum (a geometrical shape encompassing all the camera sees) is split into several parts and a shadow map is given to each split. This means that the first split, which is right in front of the camera, gets a much larger shadow-per-pixel ratio than the last split, which is much larger, but further away (and hence has small on-screen pixels).<br /><br />The algorithm itself is pretty easy, especially since there is quite a few papers on it. The big problem is that you can get some flickering results because the shadow map can change a lot. There are published techniques that solve this fairly easy though. Most of my time was instead spent on making it work with the rest of the engine. This is something that might not be that known to non-programmers, but most of the work is often not in the algorithm itself but fitting it into the engine design.  I think I spend a 3-4 days on getting it inside the engine, before I had everything set up as it should. The actually algorithm took 2 days or so.<br /><br />Here is how it looks:<br /><a href=\"http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_QfesHslH-uc/TLXekV4u91I/AAAAAAAAAPM/VANXyzbye7k/s1600/shadows.jpg\"><img style=\"display: block; margin: 0px auto 10px; text-align: center; cursor: pointer; width: 400px; height: 300px;\" src=\"http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_QfesHslH-uc/TLXekV4u91I/AAAAAAAAAPM/VANXyzbye7k/s400/shadows.jpg\" alt=\"\" id=\"BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5527568833598912338\" border=\"0\" /></a>Note how shadows are detailed up front, yet they are cast all the way into the distance.<br /><br /><div style=\"text-align: left;\">Here is how the shadow maps look (I combine all into a single one):<br /><div style=\"text-align: center;\"><a style=\"font-style: italic;\" href=\"http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_QfesHslH-uc/TLXfLQtMRUI/AAAAAAAAAPU/sNdug9dOtUM/s1600/shadow_slices.jpg\"><img style=\"display: block; margin: 0px auto 10px; text-align: center; cursor: pointer; width: 388px; height: 96px;\" src=\"http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_QfesHslH-uc/TLXfLQtMRUI/AAAAAAAAAPU/sNdug9dOtUM/s400/shadow_slices.jpg\" alt=\"\" id=\"BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5527569502223222082\" border=\"0\" /></a><span style=\"font-style: italic;\">Probably  want to enlarge this by clicking!</span><br /></div></div><div style=\"text-align: center;\"><br /></div>These are the four shadow maps that all render shadows for different slices of the frustum.

For example: \"A princess is kidnapped; a  brave knight rides to save her; the knight faces a dragon, the knight slays dragon and saves the princess; finally the knight gets half the kingdom and marries the princess\". Most likely, one also thinks of even smaller details as integrated parts of the story; the way in which the princess is kidnapped, how the knight struggles against the dragon, and so on.<br /><br />This is not the right way to think of stories. The chain of events is just the <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">plot</span>, and it is a device used in order to get the story across to an audience. What really lies at the core of the story are themes, locations, emotions, and so on. Pretty much all stories we have heard in our lives have been plot-based, but this is because this has been pretty much the only way of telling them. Now that we have videogames as a widespread medium this is no longer true. Still, the idea that story equals plot remain strong. It is a common belief that when a game becomes less linear, it is less about the story. I do not think this is true and if we want to advance the storytelling of the medium,  this view needs to go.<br /><br /><br /><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">By the Campfire</span><br />Humans have been telling stories for a long, long time, well before the dawn of civilization. These stories were not written down, but spread by being told over and over, never repeated exactly the same way. These kind of \"camp fire stories\" still remain, traveling from person to person, constantly evolving and changing. Yet, while the way the stories are told change, in a way they still remain the same. Anyone who has ever told a story like this knows that you often never know the exact words. Instead, you know of certain important things the story is supposed to \"say\".<br /><br />It is very common that you change a story like this depending on your audience. If the people listening do not seem impressed by the hero's strength, you add more details,  more events, descriptions and dialog. Your goal when telling the story is not be give an exact replication of how the story was told to you. What you are trying to do is to copy the <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">impact </span>the story had on you and any change you can do in order to accomplish this is a valid one.<br /><br />The moment you do something like this, you have realized, although perhaps unconsciously, that the essence of the story its not the words that make it up. Instead, the story is about something on a higher level.<br /><br /><br /><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">Peeling an Onion</span><br />When a section of a story is trying to convince the audience how strong a hero is, it is something that exists above the words that make it up. Still, this \"strong hero\" theme, might not be at the highest level either and simply be a vessel for a yet greater goal. Perhaps it sets up an overarching theme of how even the strong will eventually fall. The levels might not stop even there and eventually the essence of the story might be boiled down to a few essentials. These essentials is what the story is <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">really</span> about. Remove any of these and the structure collapse and the original story is no more.<br /><br />It is also important to have in mind that some levels might be connected. Something that is at a higher level might not manage to stand on its own. A certain part of the story might be about the hero overcoming overwhelming odds and is meant to provoke sympathy. At the same time it is about the hero being subjected to torture and treated very badly by some people. If you remove the torture part, then what you have left is only two very fuzzy themes and not something that alone can build the story. Thus it is not always so that the important pieces of a story are all on the highest level, but they might spread out in a hierarchy. And while this might actually continue down to the very lowest level, it can only do so if removing the part destroys the story. It is not a way to justify that every single detail is essential.<br /><br />I think most people already have these layers in their mind when thinking up a story, but then along the way give great weight to the details on the lowest level. This is especially harmful when making games, something I will address shortly. First I must go over what I mean by the essence of a story.<br /><br /><br /><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">What is the Essence?</span><br />One might argue that a certain story is not possible to distill into a few high level concepts. It could be argued that a certain scene must be in a very specific way; that one cannot simply describe it as some flimsy themes. I think this happens if one thinks that the themes must be deep, thought provoking, artsy, or whatnot. This is not what I mean with the essence though and it can be any number of things.<br /><br />For example take the \"attack on the village\"-scene in the movie <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0093773/\">Predator</a>, something I am sure few people would call deep, thought-provoking or similar. What are the high level concepts here? Is it just be boiled down to \"mindless violence\", \"how the civilized world rapes nature\" or anything similarly pretentious? Not so. Instead its essence is things like the environment, the oppressing jungle; to have a team of sweaty super-humans storm a village, showing off destruction and gunfighting. At a higher level it is also meant to  be fun watching and must keep a certain distance to reality and stay away from certain things (like murdering of innocents) in order to keep the audience entertained.<br /><br />What I want to show here is that a story does not need to be have some kind of moral lesson, ask an existential question, or whatever deep meaning, at its core. It can be shallow and just for fun. Even so, there <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">is </span>an essence and it is what really matters in the story.<br /><br />Consider any good book/movie you have ever read/seen. Is it really the lowest level of events and details that made you like it? Was it not the locations it took you to? Was it not the interesting relationship between character? Or the way slowly uncovering a mystery made you feel? I argue that no story, no matter what sort, is not about the exact way in things happen, but about the essence of these events. This is something that is crucial to have in mind in video games, as simply nailing down a few details that satisfy the essence is not enough. A video game is a living, breathing world and the essence needs to be portrayed through the right use of the mechanics (such as gameplay, art, sound, etc).<br /><br /><br /><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">Stories in Videogames</span><br />Actually videogames already use this kind of story telling! For example, first person shooters have not set the exact sequence how people get shot or houses blown up. The thing that matters is that people <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">do</span> get shot and houses <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">do</span> get blown up. Exactly how this happens is not important for the story, only that the essence of the action stays the same.<br /><br />The same is true for portrayal of environments in most games. It does not matter how the protagonist traverse or interact with it, the designer simply constructs a world and the rest is up to the player. By setting up the mechanics of the game a certain way, the designer then pretty much guarantees that the player will have a specific kind of experience and that the essence is kept intact.<br /><br />However, this how far it goes in most the games today. Once a videogame gets to trickier parts of the story, lower level details are given more and more importance. When it comes to concepts like love, betrayal and grief, pretty much all current games rely on a specific set of events, a plot, to convey them. No longer does it consider the essence of the story. Instead, it becomes focused on the low-level details.  Take <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/God_of_War_%28video_game%29\">God of War</a> as an example. There is no need to have cut-scenes showing how angry and prone to violence Kratos is - the gameplay does this for us. But when it is time to bring up other emotions, like showing the reasons behind his rage, the game resorts to plot-based cut scenes.<br /><br />This does not have to be the case. I think that just about any essence can be expressed by a virtual world guiding the player using various mechanics. This can be conveyed just as good, or perhaps even better, than what a carefully planned plot is able to.   I believe we are already seeing this with deeper themes such as a fear. As has been proved by games like <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silent_Hill_%28video_game%29\">Silent Hill</a>*, over ten years ago, video games can be used to provoke fear in a way that is impossible to do in any other medium. While certain kinds of horror lends itself extremely well to the video game medium, I see no reason why other emotions and themes can not work just as well. There are of course also games like <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fallout_%28video_game%29\">Fallout</a> and <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shadow_of_the_Colossus\">Shadow of the Colossus</a> that touch upon other themes without using a plot, giving a glimpse of what could be achieved. However, this is just the tip of an iceberg and videogames as a story telling medium is still far from where it could be.<br /><br /><br /><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">End thoughts</span><br />Abandoning plot and a linear progression does not mean that one is creating a sandbox game. It simply means that one picks out the essence of the story and design  a virtual world that delivers just that. I believe that sticking to old fashion cut-scenes is a dead end if we want video game story telling to progress. Instead we need to look at a higher level, figure out the essence of our stories and focus on that. When this way of creating a story reaches into areas previously reserved to films and books, storytelling in game will be a force to truly reckon with.<br /><br /><br /><span style=\"font-style: italic;\">* A major inspiration for Silent Hill was the movie </span><a style=\"font-style: italic;\" href=\"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0099871/\">Jacob's ladder,</a><span style=\"font-style: italic;\"> and this serves as an excellent example of how to take the essence of a story and putting it in a different medium. Compare the movie's </span><a style=\"font-style: italic;\" href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ttcof7TQ-Mw\">hospital scene</a><span style=\"font-style: italic;\"> to the otherworld found in Silent Hill and you will find there is a remarkable keeping of its essence. The feeling of being trapped, the environment, the sound design, the uncertainty of what is real and even the style of music. Silent Hill shares very little in terms of low-level plot details with the movie, and yet they manage to be remarkably similar.</span><div class=\"blogger-post-footer\"><img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/9193968969153274146-3146634987607734663?l=frictionalgames.blogspot.com' alt='' /></div>") (link ((rel .

And since the <a href=\"http://frictionalgames.blogspot.com/2010/09/one-week-after-release-of-amnesia.html\">post on a week after release</a> was quite popular, we have decided to do a new overview on where we stand now. This time we will mainly focus on the sales and give some more accurate figures on how things have turned out for us.<br /><br /><br /><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">The big picture</span><br />So, with one month of data to analyze, how did things go? I think it can be summed up with: <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">Better than expected on all accounts</span>! As of today we have sold a total of 36, 000 units (including pre-orders, but excluding boxed sales in Russia), and our goal,  which would determine if we would continue or not, were 24,000. Having met and exceeded that goal already feels quite nice. Frictional Games will live to create another game!<br /><br />15,000 (41.7%) of all sales were in the form of pre-orders, which is quite significant. Part of the explanation for this is that there was a 20% discount during pre-orders and we also believe that people are more inclined to buy a pre-order. With perks such as Steam pre-loading, people seem to think it is worth putting up money before release. And since there is no pirate alternative to a pre-order, it is more likely that people will go through with the purchase (more on pirating later). In any case, pre-orders is probably something we will focus on more for our next title.<br /><br /><br /><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">Platform specifics</span><br />Gathering an exact percentage of sales for Linux turned out to be a bit complicated. Purchases made in our store gets all three platforms, which is the only place to get the Linux version. The total amount of sold units in our own store is about 5000. Since we can connect some of these sales with steam activations and similar, we can make a conservative estimate of 2500 Windows users, leaving 2500 left for Mac and Linux. And since this this is the only store for Linux users, we assume 70% of these are Linux. This means 1750 sold Linux units, or 5% of the total sales.<br /><br />Mac sales are a bit simpler to estimate, and given the estimates from above plus some other data, comes to about 8% of the total sales. The interesting bit here is that just taking the last week into account the amount of mac sales lie at about 12%. This probably means that the Mac market takes longer to penetrate and that Mac owners might be more likely to buy an \"old\" game. Unfortunately we do not have data regarding this for Linux, but assume something similar happens there.<br /><br /><br /><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">Media and user response</span><br />As we said in the <a href=\"http://frictionalgames.blogspot.com/2010/09/one-week-after-release-of-amnesia.html\">last post</a>, the response from the media and users have been overwhelming to say the least. Right now, we have 86% at <a href=\"http://www.metacritic.com/game/pc/amnesia-the-dark-descent/critic-reviews\">Metacritic</a>, 90% from users on <a href=\"http://www.gamespot.com/pc/adventure/amnesiathedarkdescent/players.html?tag=tabs%3Breviews\">Gamespot</a>, and so on. Considering it is a niche and story based game this feels extra nice (which, as Kieron Gillen <a href=\"http://www.rockpapershotgun.com/2010/09/29/i-am-the-mob-mafia-ii-subjectivity-and-story/\">points out on RPS</a>, usually get lower meta-scores). We could not be any happier than we are with this response.<br /><br />So how has this affected the sales? Well it is obviously impossible to say what we would have sold with worse grades, but what we can do is to see what correlations there are between positive reviews and spikes in sales.  It turns out there is pretty much none. The only correlation we managed to find was with combined release of the <a href=\"http://www.escapistmagazine.com/videos/view/zero-punctuation/2092-Amnesia-The-Dark-Descent\">Zero punctuation</a> and <a href=\"http://www.gamespot.com/pc/adventure/amnesiathedarkdescent/review.html\">Gamespot </a>reviews. These were out very close in time and almost quadrupled sales compared to the previous days before (about 150/day to 600/day). It even seems like this boost still remains.<br /><br />Apart from this example, it has not been possible to find any other correlations. Part of this is probably due to the noisy nature of the data; many reviews come out at the same time they overlap and it is not possible to discern individual contributions. However, when articles have been alone in time, there still have not been any noticeable spikes. One explanation is that it might be hard for people to find out where the game is bought, as our website is seldom mentioned in previews/reviews. This is especially true for the time before the pre-order became available at the major online retailers. Another explanation is that most reviews have more of a long term effect, instead of an instant sales boost. What this means is that reviews convince players that already know about the game to purchase it, instead of acting as a PR catalyst.<br /><br />What reviews does do is to make other publications find out about you. Getting a review in a high-status outlet have meant mails from many other publications and convinced other media folk that the game is worth writing about. Thus, as mentioned previously, good review help sales in a long term perspective.<br /><br /><br /><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">Pirating</span><br />Now it is time to discuss pirating and how this has affected us. First of all, it is quite easy to see that there are tons of torrents/shared files of Amnesia available. When we search the web to see if any news on Amnesia has popped up, almost 50% of the results go to a pirated version of the game. This is of course makes us sad, but it is also something one has to deal with when living in today's world. We are well aware that the same technology that allows pirating of our game, is the same that enabled us create the game in the first place. Without a fast Internet and a connected world we would never be able to work together or distribute our games. But this does not mean that we should just ignore piracy and it is important to figure out what kind of impact it has on us.<br /><br />As I have said, the sales have been above what we had expected, but compared to the response we have gotten it still feels kind of low. For example, the very hyped <a href=\"http://www.minecraft.net/\">Minecraft </a>has gotten <a href=\"http://m00d.net/minecraft/sales/\">more than ten times the sales</a> compared us. While being a vastly different game compared to Amnesia, there are some differences that are worth discussing. In terms of the amount of PR received, I would say that Minecraft is more well known, but Amnesia is not far behind. Google gives us two times the hits compared to them and a popular pirate site gives Minecraft double the distributors compared to us. We have gotten more reviews from popular outlets, Minecraft has gotten more viral-like PR. As I said, I think Minecraft has the upper hand here, but not by that much. Still, Minecraft has a over ten  times the sales compared to Amnesia, which is a huge difference.<br /><br />Our conclusion is that a large part of this is due to the lack of pirating in Minecraft compared to us. As I mentioned above, Minecraft has 10x the sales, but only 2x the torrent distributors. A Google search on the subject also turns up twice the hits for Amnesia. It seems like more people are pirating Amnesia and we think there are two main reasons for this. Both of them are related to the single-player nature of the experience.<br /><br />First of all, once you have played Amnesia there is little meaning to play again. A person pirating the game and finishing it has no real reason to go back. So even if a player likes it and determines that it is well worth paying for, there is no incentive to do so. It is quite common to read on forums that people have downloaded a pirated version and say that they will probably buy it later. The question here is how many actually does this? Even if you really liked the game and want to support the developers, it basically feels like money down the drain since you get nothing extra after paying. This is not the case for a game like Minecraft where more content is released all the time and the game is designed to be highly replayable (and darn it for that, damn time consumer!).<br /><br />The second reason is the lack of any proper protection. Not only does Amnesia not have any real protection from the start, there is almost no way for us to force people into buying ad-hoc. What we can do is to release patches, but this only affect people that have not been able to start the game, a small part of the user base. So once the game is out we are basically screwed and we can not do much to make people chose a legal over a pirated one. Minecraft requires a server connection and is constantly updated, effectively pushing people towards buying the legit version.<br /><br />So what to do about this? One way is to create different kinds of games, where we can implement these sort of things. But that just feels wrong. A developer should not design a game based on how it can be protected and doing so can only lead to bad things for our games (to avoid feeding potential flames; this is based on what we want to do with our games, not what we think of others who might do this). What we want to continue doing is to create single player games that try to evolve the way in which videogames tell stories and evoke emotions. Another option is to expand our horizons and try other platforms. This is what we are currently looking into. We do not know what this will mean as of yet,  but hopefully we can continue to expand platforms and not limit them.<br /><br /><br /><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">Our situation</span><br />So what does all this money talk mean for Frictional Games as a  company? The most positive news is that we have recouped all expenses from creating Amnesia. This is of course awesome, but it needs to be taken into account that we worked long days at a very low salary, using minimal expenses. Our next game will not be possible to do on a budget like that.<br /><br />For the team, it is now finally back to more normal salaries. This still means that we are paid below, or just at, minimum wage (there is not an actual minimum specified by law, we just mean according to standards) here in Sweden though. We have made some calculations and if we were to increase salaries to normal levels, our current earnings would only last for a year and a half at most. We estimate that it will take at least two years to complete our upcoming game and there are more expenses involved than salaries for the five team members (check the credits for Amnesia!). So right now, we have to stick to having low salaries and see how sales pan out.<br /><br />At the time of writing our daily sales are at around 350 units, but it fluctuates quite a bit and it is hard to see how it will be in the long term. I said in the <a href=\"http://frictionalgames.blogspot.com/2010/09/one-week-after-release-of-amnesia.html\">previous post</a> that the sales were dropping drastically, but this actually stopped a day or so after posting. Our hope is that it will end up at around 70 per day, as this means that the day-to-day sales would cover monthly salary costs. The money earned at launch could then be used for other expenses and perhaps help us reach more common wages. Very hard to say when a steady level will been reached though. For the Penumbra games it happened two weeks or so after release, but PR for Amnesia is still pouring in, so we assume at least another month.<br /><br /><br /><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">Final thoughts</span><br />Hopefully this post has give some kind of insight into sales for  a PC game and where Frictional Games stand now. We are really happy how Amnesia have turned out in all ways. While sales could have been better, people are still buying it and will hopefully continue to. If it stabilizes at a good level, things are looking very bright indeed.<br /><br />We also feel that we finally can leave Amnesia behind us and start focusing on our next project instead. As this will be our first project where we know from the start that we can finance it ourselves, it will be very interesting to see what can be done. In all our previous games, we have mostly rushed through the production. This is will be the first time we can take our time and make sure that all is the way we want it to.<br /><br />Exciting times lie ahead and we hope you all will follow us into the future as well!<div class=\"blogger-post-footer\"><img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/9193968969153274146-1669926905785388587?l=frictionalgames.blogspot.com' alt='' /></div>") (link ((rel .

The film is a about a film-maker starting to make a movie in memory of his murdered friend, when some unexpected developments ensues. It is an experience, straight from reality, that swings you between laughter and heartbreaking despair. I urge you all to see it.<br /><br />The reason why I want to bring this up, is because this movie has something that video games lack: it has been made with the intent to share something deep and meaningful. It is has not been made to create a fun experience or for commercial gain. It has been made from love and with a very serious goal in mind. The passion that was put into this movies seeps through every frame and it really brings the movie home. Kurt Kuenne, the maker of the film, has something he is truly emotional about and pulls no punches in driving that point home.<br /><br />This sort of thing just isn't found in games. Almost all games start as some kind mechanic, which is then iterated until fun enough, and anything resembling a deeper meaning is slapped on afterwards. Sure, there are games like <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shadow_of_the_Colossus\">Shadow of Colossus</a>, that strive toward creating a battle with gigantic creatures, or <a href=\"http://www.molleindustria.org/everydaythesamedream/everydaythesamedream.html\">Everyday the same dream</a>, which quite obviously go beyond its low-level mechanics. But these still lack the kind of emotional investment that is seen other media. I understand a film like Dear Zachary gets a lot of emotional weight from being a true story, but that is not the point. What I am after is the motivation that drove its creation, the passion behind making it and uncompromising attitude in the way which the meaning is brought forward.<br /><br />The motivation I am looking for does not need to be the gut-wrenchingly sad story that Dear Zachary tells. It can be whatever emotional experience that lies the creator close at heart. Sad, funny, beautiful, aweinspiring, interesting, disturbing, educational, it does not matter. As along as the end goal is not just to give the player a fun past time, it is a step in the right direction. Screw developments in storytelling techniques, writing, facial animations, full body input, etc. When games are a made with only a fraction of the passion that went into Dear Zachary, the videogame medium is on the path towards true greatness.<br /><br /><span style=\"font-style: italic;\">(For those interested, two more posts discussing similar themes are found </span><a style=\"font-style: italic;\" href=\"http://frictionalgames.blogspot.com/2010/01/how-gameplay-and-narrative-kill-meaning.html\">here </a><span style=\"font-style: italic;\">and </span><a style=\"font-style: italic;\" href=\"http://frictionalgames.blogspot.com/2010/02/exploring-deeper-meaning-in-games.html\">here</a><span style=\"font-style: italic;\">).</span><div class=\"blogger-post-footer\"><img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/9193968969153274146-768670701477053775?l=frictionalgames.blogspot.com' alt='' /></div>") (link ((rel .

The general consensus of these posts was that games should not be judged by their length, but if the experience feels complete or not. Something that we here at Frictional Games agree on.<br /><br />Now that we have released <a href=\"http://www.amnesiagame.com/\">Amnesia: The Dark Descent</a>, game length has once again come into our lives. There have been several reviews of the game that have stated that the game's length, 6 - 10 hours, was a major negative.  Especially considering that the game does not have any replayability (although that is up for discussion).<br /><br />This has made us a bit concerned. A major goal with our games is to have no fillers, to have a game where everything is focused on creating a certain experience. Since we do not have combat in our games, there is no way to extend length in a simple way (like filling a room with enemies). Just about every minute in our games requires lots of time and effort to implement. If we are to keep on improving the quality of our games, 6 - 10 hours is pretty much the maximum amount of gameplay time we can create.<br /><br />Especially now that the first week of sales, despite <a href=\"http://gameinformer.com/games/amnesia_the_dark_descent/b/pc/archive/2010/09/08/horror-done-right.aspx\">overwhelmingly </a><a href=\"http://www.rockpapershotgun.com/2010/09/07/wot-i-think-amnesia-the-dark-descent/\">excellent</a> <a href=\"http://www.adventuregamers.com/article/id,1206\">response</a>, were only moderate (more on that <a href=\"http://frictionalgames.blogspot.com/2010/09/one-week-after-release-of-amnesia.html\">here</a>), this makes us a bit concerned. If 6 - 10 hours for a $20 game gives it a negative mark, what if we increase the price to $30, would this drastically decrease the positive response? Even more serious, this negative feedback on the game's length has made us having discussion topics like \"how do we make this section longer?\". We try to push this aside and instead focus on more important topics such as \"how do make this section more engaging?\", but it is still nagging at the back of our heads. Focusing on game length, is something I find can have very negative effect on a game's design (discussed a bit <a href=\"http://frictionalgames.blogspot.com/2010/01/when-focusing-on-fun-fails.html\">here</a>).<br /><br />With this background information, we would like to hear your thoughts on this issue!

There is a a lot to say really, but I will try and be brief and only concentrate on the most important things.<br /><br /><br /><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">Making the game available</span><br />This was the first time that we have had a game that would be simultaneously released for six different stores on the same day, so we were a bit nervous on how that would go. To make sure that all stores had enough time we sent out the game more than a week before release. This seems to have worked and all the stores had the game available in time for release.<br /><br />Added to this, we also had a system for pre-order customers to get their download link, serial key and Steam key. Jens have tried this over a month before release and it was very well tested once released. The only problem was some mix up with keys and people loosing their mail, otherwise all went well.<br /><br />In summary, we are quite happy how the availability of the game turned out and we actually expected there to be more unknown factors popping up and make our lives harder.<br /><br /><br /><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">Press Response</span><br />We had already gotten a few previews and thought we had some idea where the reviews would land. However, reality turned out far beyond our expectations. There has some extremely positive response (as can be seen on the <a href=\"http://www.amnesiagame.com/\">game's page</a> and at <a href=\"http://www.metacritic.com/game/pc/amnesia-the-dark-descent/critic-reviews\">meta critic</a>) and we are extremely happy about this. From all the graded reviews so far, all but three have been 80+ (about half of these 90+) and interestingly two of the less positive ones had has a major complaint that there was too much horror in the game. Which in a way makes us happy as well...<br /><br />We have also been able to reach out to a lot of media, and most major sites have covered the game. A bit disappointingly, a few sites that reviewed and covered the <a href=\"http://penumbragame.com/\">Penumbra </a>games have not mentioned Amnesia. We assume this is because we no longer have a publisher and thus lack the proper channels. For the Penumbra games we handled very little of the marketing ourself and thus lacked email/contacts to many sites (we still tried to contact all media we could think of though).<br /><br /><br /><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">Player response</span><br />Like reviews, response from player has gone beyond our expectations. We noticed this first at the release of the demo. We were unsure of how interesting it would be, but it was received very well. Since then, the name Amnesia has spread like wildfire across the Internets. I think there have been more videos, discussions, etc released at the time of writing than we have accumulated for any of the Penumbra games.  It is also telling that the within 24 hours of release, pretty much all major secrets in the game was found out (it took much longer for the Penumbra games).<br /><br /><br /><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">Piracy</span><br />I think the most alarming thing was that the game was available as a pirated copy 24 hours or so before release. This kind of 0-day release can be quite hurtful, as otherwise paying customers might be  so anxious to play that they pirate and then forget to pay for it. Since we released the game online only, we were not expecting this and the source of the illegal copy was one of our review copies (with tracking info hacked away). We are not sure what to do about this in the future, but we will have to be more careful and perhaps not send out review copies to so many outlets.  It could have gone a lot worse though as a the first review copies (of early builds) were sent out almost a month before release.<br /><br /><br /><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">Sales</span><br />As many of you might already know Amnesia is a sort of make or break game for us. At the time of writing, we are very close to our \"all is good\"-goal, meaning that we are still in business (due to contractual stuff we cannot release any numbers right now)! However, there are a few \"buts\" to all this.<br /><br />The response we got from the game is a lot better than we expected, yet the sales are only \"good\" according to our, much more modest, expected response. This makes us wonder what sales we would have gotten if the response would have been more like what we thought it would be. If this is our time in the spotlight, then a lot less noticed game would probably put us out of business. As it looks now, we still have to be quite careful in budgeting our next game (although much less careful than what we had to be with Amnesia). We were hoping a really successful release would makes 100% unworried about finances, but that is not what has happened.<br /><br />Can we really judge sales from just one week? According to current graphs: yes we can. Even though reviews keep coming in from major outlets and we keep pushing out marketing material (videos, release of tools, etc) sales are dropping fast. Around 50% of our current earnings where made in less than a week and on pre-orders from before release. The sales where at the top during the last hour of the Steam 20% discount, and has since dropped almost exponentially, being pretty much halved each day. It will be really interesting to see at what level it pans out.<br /><br />This is of course not all the income we will make from the game, but is still a bit discouraging when comparing to recent XBLA releases and similar. So why is not sales higher? Piracy? People waiting for future massive discounted sales? Game too scary / niched? Right now we have not got a clue, but hopefully it will become clearer further on.<br /><br />Finally, as this was a multi-platform release, some preliminary sales distribution should be of interest. Around 90% was windows users, 5% Linux and 5% Mac. In defense of  Mac and Linux we did concentrate our marketing efforts on the Windows user base.<br /><br /><br /><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">Technical Issues</span><br />When releasing for PC, there is bound to be tons of technical problems, especially since we released for three different OS. So it is kinda surprising that it has not been that much. As with Penumbra, the number one problem has been OpenGL driver issues, something we unfortunately cannot control.<br /><br />The largest single issue is probably the problems the ATI X-series and below range of cards for Windows. I'd like to add that we had tried it on a 9600 for a Mac successfully, but on Windows it fails due to various issues. In a way this is a driver issue too, but I think it might be some piece of code that it simply dislikes and I am hoping to fix it for an upcoming patch.<br /><br />In general game issues, there have been less than expected too. There is the standard falling out of the map and physics messed up bugs, but less than we thought there would be. In-game crashes are also very few (most caused by some cache issues it seems), which is nice and we feel that the game is quite stable.<br /><br /><br /><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">Game feedback</span><br />There has been a ton of feedback for the game and we try to read and discuss most of it. Discussing in detail would take up too much space so I will just take up two points, that I found extra important.<br /><br />The main thing we will do for our next game is to skip any \"forced\" and incoherent mechanics. What I mean by this is puzzles that does not really make sense in the game world and break the immersion. An example would be the corpse-puzzle that forces the player to use very specific items to complete it. Trying to get rid of all these elements and further increase the feeling of being part of an actual world, will be one of our top priorities.<br /><br />One of the main themes of the game, was for the player to slowly regain lost memories and to make up their mind about Daniel (ie their past self).  While most still refer to the protagonist as \"Daniel\" (and not \"me\"), many players have really thought about the details discovered in a way we hoped. The game medium is so great for setting the audience at the center of the drama and force them to take a stance. It feels as if many people did this in Amnesia, and we hope to take this even further and on different subjects for future games.<br /><br /><br /><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">Final thoughts</span><br />On almost all fronts, we area extremely pleased with this release. It has in many ways exceeded our expectations and it makes all the hard work, pay cuts, etc worth it in the end.<br /><br />The most distressing thing is the sales though. Even though we are far from complaining, it feels like we do not have the financial security we would like to have, to truly be able to focus on making the best game possible. So what should we do? The things we have discussed include: Increase the cost of the game, doing a console port instead of Linux/Mac, do a less niche title and more. Now is too soon to make a decision though and we have to see how the coming weeks and months go.<br /><br />Finally, I know I say this a lot but we truly mean it: Thanks to all who have supported us by buying the game, spreading the word, and what not. We hope you all will continue supporting us in the future as well! All of Frictional Games sends their finest regards and thanks for this support!<div class=\"blogger-post-footer\"><img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/9193968969153274146-555808245564553290?l=frictionalgames.blogspot.com' alt='' /></div>") (link ((rel .

I had an idea of starting the video with a <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Lynch\">lynchian </a>stare, that should set the mood for the rest of the trailer. My design process was then for me to lock myself inside a dark room, lie on the floor and mumble stuff while gesticulating in the air.<br /><br />I then showed the synopsis to Jens and when he had approved after some smaller changes, I set Marcus and Luis to work with recording.  I gave them descriptions on how I wanted the clips to be, they then recorded something, sent sample and I mostly told em tons of stuff to improve. It took a day and something like 5 - 50 retakes for each shot (one ended up not being used) to complete. We now had the clips!<br /><br />One clip was missing though: Some fancy logo animation! This we could not do ourselves so I started looking for a company to do it for us. This turned out much harder than I thought! First finding a company was a pain; all I ended up finding where wedding photographers and the like. Nothing what we needed obviously. After some work I manged to find 19 different companies and mailed em. Three replied! All of which where fully booked or on vacation of course. But from one company, whose staff was on holiday, we got a tip about <a href=\"http://atmospheres.co.uk/\">Atmospheres</a>, a UK company that ended up doing the animation. I think it ended up very nice! Especially given the time and resource limits we had to give the company.<br /><br />Jens now started working on the editing. This has caused us tons of trouble with all codecs and other crap that never works out as planned (blog post about it <a href=\"http://frictionalgames.blogspot.com/2009/12/video-editing-hell-linux-to-resuce.html\">here</a>), but Jens has started to master it now and is usually pretty quick. So he cut and mixed with the cut em together, which took half a day or so. I contributed with the graphics for the texts and some quote mining (a skill any dev needs to learn!). After some minor fixes, the editing was done!<br /><br />Finally was time for Jens to put sound on it. You see, in order to get nice sound you do not keep anything from the original clips, and add new sounds for all. Otherwise you get all kinds of cut off sounds between cuts. It ended up taking Jens over three days to complete this (and is why \"launch\" trailer is not on launch). The final project file contained 52 tracks, each track having hundreds of sound samples.<br /><br />Fun fact is that this process of design -> graphics -> editing (scripting) -> sounds is pretty much how we made levels in Amnesia!<br /><br />There you have the story! Lots a work for a little over two minutes. Hopefully it will lure someone into buying! :)<div class=\"blogger-post-footer\"><img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/9193968969153274146-1515104594388073716?l=frictionalgames.blogspot.com' alt='' /></div>") (link ((rel .

Now ask your friend to stroke the fake and real hand at the same time, at the same place. Something strange will now happen. Your body image will change, and the rubber hand will become part of you. As your friend touch both hands, you will feel as if the feeling arise in the rubber one. All of a sudden, you will have made an external object, become part of your self!<br /><br />With this experiment in mind. The question of where <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">you </span>are becomes more interesting. When playing a game, where do you transport your self to? Does it depend on what the game is about and from what perspective it is played from?<br /><br />I think this is not only an interesting curiosity, but a very important part of the experience.  Identifying where the player is when playing, can be very useful. And even more crucial, being able to \"place\" the player correctly is a very useful skill.<br /><br /><br /><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">Spectator or something else?</span><br />Let's start simple and explore movies first. In movies there is no interaction, so surely you must be a spectator to every scene in a movie. A clear example of this, is when you see a horror movie and have one of those \"don't go in there!\"-moments. This clearly puts you in a spectator seat, treating the actor as a separate entity.<br /><br />However, things does not get so polarized in other situations. Consider a gruesome torture scene or similar. These can get almost unbearable to watch and blurs the line between yourself and the actor.  The reason why this is so is because of something called mirror neurons (<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0pwKzTRG5E\">here </a>is a good video on the subject). What these do is to make you copy emotions from other people, replicating some of their sensations. One could even argue that they expand yourself, no longer limiting it to your own body.<br /><br /><br /><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">Interaction added</span><br />Let's go back to games now. As we can see there are two forces at work: we can trick our brain into extending the body image and we have specialized neurons that copy other people's emotions. How these will affect us will depend on what type of videogame we are playing.<br /><br />One of the major differences between games today is the viewpoint, ie first or third person. Does this matter? First person places you inside a character, putting your viewpoint where it usually is. This increases the feeling of being the character. In third person, you are removed from reality, and look upon yourself as if in some kind of <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Out-of-body_experience\">OBE</a>. This might make one think first person is superior, however, this only applies to the sense of sight. Another important sense is the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proprioception\">proprioceptic </a>one, which keeps track of your different body parts. When in first person, you see at most a hand or two, while in third-person gives you a full body image to copy. Third person can also give your mirror-neurons more to work with, like facial expressions. So depending on the kind of actions you perform, first or third will have a different feeling of <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">being</span>.<br /><br />Also worth noting is how easily we shift between different states. For example, in Silent Hill 2, I feel very much connected to James when I run around town. Then when entering a cut-scene, I sort of float out of him and become distanced.  I am no longer in control of the character and no longer part of him. Then when controls comes back I once more float inside him and the virtual characters becomes an extension of my own body again. This kind of movement happen in just about all games.<br /><br /><br /><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">The roles we play</span><br />Now that we have explored how the self can shift position as we play a videogame, an interesting question arise: What is the player's role in these different positions? As videogames contain interaction; not only do you fee,l to various degrees, part of the on-screen character, you also control her/him/it.  What does this make the player? Some kind of puppet master? An devil/angel on the shoulder? And more importantly, can the role assumed, change how the game is played?<br /><br />In most games, you do not control all actions in a game, but mostly give general commands. You tell your character to jump, but not how much force to use and so on. You command a character to pick up an item, but have no control over any finer movements. This is not that far off from real life though, as most of your day-to-day movements are made without any conscious thought besides the thought of initiating them. This means that making a character jump by pressing a button gives you a very close connection. In these instances, you might feel like you <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">are</span> the character.<br /><br />However, not all games have this close connection. Consider an adventure game where you just pick a destination for the character or choose between prefabricated lines of dialog. What role does this give the player? Some kind of guardian angle - a guiding voice inside the protagonist's head? Does this change the way that the player think of the character and how to interact with the game? Perhaps this role-assignment distances the player emotionally from the game's protagonist?<br /><br />It is interesting that some games actually explicitly give the player a role. This is quite common in adventure games, where the protagonist might look at the player and directly address her.  Do developers really consider how this can affect the placement of the player's self? I must confess I have not thought about this until very recently and have not heard of many discussing it.<br /><br />I think it is very important to decide where the player is and what her role is. If this is not coherent than it might have a negative effect on how the player choose to interact with the game's world. If you know your role  in the game, it gets easier to be immersed in it and know how to behave. This does not mean that the assigned role and placement of self needs to be the same throughout, but that it must be consistent with what needs to be done. A simple example of when this goes wrong is quick-time-events during cut-scenes. This can be very confusing at first, as you have just gone from being the character (in normal play mode) and gone to spectator mode (when cut-scene is playing). All of sudden you are required to control the character, something that is not coherent with your current role.<br /><br />This shift in placement also explains why emotional moments can be hard to get right in cut-scenes. As you enter a cut scene you move over to \"spectator mode\" and all of a sudden you are no longer as connected to the character as before and do not care as much. JPRG:s like <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Final_Fantasy_VII\">Final Fantasy 7</a> have it easier here, as the normal gameplay is more close to a \"spectator mode\" and thus the difference is smaller when entering a cut-scene. Same goes for a game like Heavy Rain. An important thing to note here is that contrast in position seem to play a huge role. When there is a violent shift in the location of self, it is very noticeable and the emotional connections are lost.<br /><br />Finally, I also want to add that the same game, can have players assume very different roles to themselves. A good, although a bit extreme, example of this, is a recent <a href=\"http://www.gamasutra.com/view/feature/6100/a_journey_across_the_main_stream_.php\">Gamasutra article</a>, where the writer let his mother-in-law play the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sam_%26_Max_Save_the_World\">new Sam and Max</a>. The interesting part is that she did not release she could or <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">should </span>control the characters. She just assumed (probably from lessons learned from experiencing other media) that she should be in spectator mode. One should have this in mind when designing a game and  tutorials for it, and not just assume that a player knows what role they play.<br /><br /><br /><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">Our take on this</span><br />Location of self and the role of the player is something that I have not really thought about until we where developing Amnesia. I would therefore like to discuss how <a href=\"http://www.penumbragame.com/\">Penumbra</a> and <a href=\"http://amnesiagame.com/\">Amnesia: The Dark Descent</a> differ in this aspect. As a lot of thought have gone into making the player become the protagonist in Amnesia, it has had a different focus compared to Penumbra.<br /><br />In Penumbra, Philip narrated all the scenes, yet in normal gameplay the player very much was part of the character. As these narrations are very subtle, it gives a bit of schizophrenic impression. For example, at one point Philip comments that he does not like spiders upon seeing one scuttle by. What happens here is that we are forcing very specific emotions on the player who will either accept or reject them. If rejecting them, it means a large shift in the position of the self and Philip stops becoming a part of you. From being part of the world yourself, you are reduced to being a passenger inside Philip's head. As mentioned before, this contrast can be very bad for the immersion and the emotional connection.<br /><br />In Amnesia, our goal is for the player to become the protagonist. This is vital for the story and experience as a whole. Because of this, there are never any words spoken, and there are no Daniel-subjective comments. We hope that this will place the player's self inside the body of the protagonist, and to think about what \"I am doing\" and not what \"Daniel is doing\". Our hope is that when you encounter facts about Daniel's past, it feels like your own forgotten memories. I know this is not an easy thing, and I am not sure many players feel this way. There is also the issues of adding smaller cues like breathing and heartbeats. Since these are actions that are not totally under our control, it is not incoherent to force them onto the player, but only if the player accepts it. Judging from player comments so far, there are people on both sides and having it in is a bit risky (we are actually thinking of having them optional in the future because of this).<br /><br /><br /><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">End note</span><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">s</span><br />There is a lot more to explore,  but did not want to make an already long post longer. So consider this as just a discussion starter and a brief introduction on the subject.<br /><br /><br />Now I am really interested in hearing how you feel about this! What role do you feel that you play in different games?

You can find the clip right below and below that I will go through the various parts a bit more detailed.<br /><br /><center><object width=\"560\" height=\"340\"><param name=\"movie\" value=\"http://www.youtube.com/v/2ve0eVwjv5k?fs=1&amp;hl=en_US\"></param><param name=\"allowFullScreen\" value=\"true\"></param><param name=\"allowscriptaccess\" value=\"always\"></param><embed src=\"http://www.youtube.com/v/2ve0eVwjv5k?fs=1&amp;hl=en_US\" type=\"application/x-shockwave-flash\" allowscriptaccess=\"always\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" width=\"560\" height=\"340\"></embed></object></center><br /><br />As you can see, this is pretty much the same things that we used in <a href=\"http://www.penumbragame.com/\">Penumbra</a>. But I also hope you noticed that it is more streamlined and intuitive. Allow me to explain.<br /><br /><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">Grabbing stuff</span><br />The grab mode is what is used when interacting with objects like books, chairs and pots. In the first versions of the game, we actually had something more like in <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crysis\">Crysis</a>, where the <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4TXI2xXEInw\">object travels to a certain position</a> when interacted with. This did not feel right though, so we want back to more like in Penumbra. We then added a lot polish to this and especially the rotating mode (when holding down a button, moving mouse rotates object). Even though the object is still moved 100% by a physics simulation, it is very smooth and you can be very exact when placing. In Penumbra there was lots of lag, but that is all gone now!<br /><br /><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">Opening doors</span><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\"><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\"><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\"><br /></span></span></span>I think I spent a week or so tweaking how the door opening physics works. In Penumbra, you had to make sure to interact with the door at the right place to open it properly, which made it hard to close / open doors in stressful situations. Not so in Amnesia. Here you can click anywhere on the door and it will easy to control it. The way this is done is by estimating how to convert 2D mouse input into 3D forces. As you will never be able to get perfect correlation between mouse and object (you will always loose a dimension), this took some time to get right.  The end results feel very nice though and the things learnt for other interaction types such as levers.<br /><br />A further improvement is that doors will now stay closed / opened. In Penumbra they sometimes bounced back at you, but in Amnesia that is all fixed saving the player from many virtual/real headaches.<br /><br /><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">Desktop simulator 2000</span><br />Opening drawers is a common interaction and another area where improvements have been made. Drawers will now react faster to player movements and it is possible to have more control (in Penumbra drawers could continue sliding after you stopped moving). And just like doors, the drawers will get stay open / closed, without any annoying bouncing.<br /><br /><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">Spin round, round...</span><br />The one interaction that we got most negative feedback on in Penumbra was the wheels (valves, etc). There was the problem of where to interact as interacting at center zero leverage and made it impossible to turn. Also the actual turning movement could be hard to get right. For Amnesia, we have remade the whole system. Now it is possible to interact wherever you like and the movement required is far more intuitive. There is a special system that analyzes your mouse movements and can quickly and correctly determine which way you want to rotate. It can even approximate the speed and there is as good as no lag involved.<br /><br /><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">Closing notes</span><br />We are very proud of the physics interact we use in our games, and it is something we have worked with for almost 5 years now. It is also a very unique method, and as far as we know we are alone at using it. We will not stop at where we are now though, and hope to take physical interaction even further in the future.<br /><br />Also, I'd like to mention the fantastic <a href=\"http://www.newtondynamics.com/\">Newton Game Dynamics</a>, the physics engine that makes all of this possible in the first place!<div class=\"blogger-post-footer\"><img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/9193968969153274146-6177845882102866968?l=frictionalgames.blogspot.com' alt='' /></div>") (link ((rel .

All help is really appreciated!<br /><br />Thanks for all support so far!<br /><br /><br />Now while you are downloading I would like to discuss some of the thoughts that when into this demo. Creating demos for adventure games is hard, and more so for horror ones, where build-up and foreshadowing is so crucial. In a more action oriented game, the purpose is simply to show of the game's main mechanics (shooting, matching blocks, etc). However, in an adventure game, there is no such mechanic and it is the more holistic parts, like story, mood, etc, that shapes the experience.<br /><br />There are other problems besides showing off the game in the best possible way. It is also important to not have too many spoilers, so when starting the full game the player should not know too much. There is of course also the sale angle, you want people to be eager to buy after playing the demo.<br /><br />It was clear at once that we needed to start from the beginning of the game. The opening is crucial for understanding the game's story and putting the player in the right mood.  The problem is that our opening is quite long. Amnesia is not very action filled from the start and slowly builds up the mood. We felt that it needed to be shorter in the demo, so player could get a grasp of the game quicker. To fix this, we remade the first level a bit, so crucial items and information are found a bit earlier.  This shortens the experience, but contains the essence.<br /><br />Then it was the problem of what to show next. We wanted the demo to contain creature encounters, but as these are too slowly built up in the full game, they did not fit the demo. So after completing the first level, the player is transported about 2 hours into the game, where more stuff happens. It was then possible to let the demo go on from there and then end with a little cliffhanger. This also worked well from a spoiler viewpoint as the maps are more about atmosphere and most events have already been shown in videos.<br /><br />To further give the demo a good feel of the full game, we made the sanity mechanic be a bit more aggressive. This means that if will be easier to reach an insane state of mind than during normal play. The fear of going insane is a crucial element, so we felt we had to show it off somehow.<br /><br />I think the demo represent the full game fairly well and contains most of its major features. However, it is still in some sense a hacked-up version of the \"real thing\" and misses a lot of the atmospheric build-up.  There is also no time to show of up any of the story either (except for the initial setup), and we only focused on atmosphere for the demo. I guess this is just the way it is with demos and the same really goes for trailers and any sort of promotional material. The good thing is that if you enjoyed the demo you should like the full game even more!<br /><br />Hope you all enjoy this vertical slice of nightmare! Only a few days left until the real beast is unleashed!<div class=\"blogger-post-footer\"><img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/9193968969153274146-5531520426442173705?l=frictionalgames.blogspot.com' alt='' /></div>") (link ((rel .

I cannot talk much on behalf of my mates here at FG, so this is gonna be a pretty personal post (but can surely apply to others out there as well).<br /><br />What can keep a project from getting done? Well, there sure are tons of different causes for this to happen, but I think we can classify these in some simple categories, which I am gonna list right away:<br /><br /><br /><div style=\"text-align: center;\"><div style=\"text-align: left;\"><span style=\"font-size:100%;\"><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">Bad (or not so good) design</span><br />This is a big source for issues, issues and more issues. Think about it, if you are just patching your stuff up for your current needs, you are really gonna need a big amount of luck to be able to keep that if further additions need to be made. Also, that is bound to fall apart at some point in the future. All these generally lead to rewriting stuff from scratch, which means time in which the project is stalled.<br />For example, at the start of the project I made an object management design that worked perfectly with the 3 types of objects that we had. A few months later 2 more types needed to be added and guess what, the old design did not work! Scrap the old one and make a new fitting the old ones. Then suddenly another type is needed and of course is totally unsupported... and so on. Fortunately I got to do something that nicely fixes this now, but guess what... it's asking for a rewrite now! </span><span style=\"font-size:100%;\">Not to mention how transforms are handled, which works for now, but I really want to get it done some other way.</span><span style=\"font-size:100%;\"></span><br /><br /></div><a onblur=\"try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}\" href=\"http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_lBbebXZVQBE/TH4-bYZgpSI/AAAAAAAABYE/C82mUWkpQxQ/s1600/20060914133129-012-421-the-simpsons-homer-d-oh-posters.jpg\"><img style=\"margin: 0px auto 10px; display: block; text-align: center; cursor: pointer; width: 210px; height: 320px;\" src=\"http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_lBbebXZVQBE/TH4-bYZgpSI/AAAAAAAABYE/C82mUWkpQxQ/s320/20060914133129-012-421-the-simpsons-homer-d-oh-posters.jpg\" alt=\"\" id=\"BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5511911634074903842\" border=\"0\" /></a><span style=\"font-size:78%;\">Rule #24923 from the Gamedev code: Learn to facepalm you will have to</span><br /><div style=\"text-align: left;\"><br /></div></div><span style=\"font-size:100%;\">So what to learn from this?

You eat, sit back, hours go by and then you go to sleep again. I had these like everyday in the last month and a half.

While it might sound like a joke or exaggerating, all of the above are true stories that are actually too long to describe here (I might give details on demand).

Keeping to the Amnesia tradition it is one single clip, showing a sequence from the game. This time it's about exploration and puzzle solving. It is the puzzle part that this blog post will discuss, as it took quite some time for us to get that puzzle right.<br /><br />The puzzle is that the hatch is too heavy to lift by hand, but by using a crank and pulley contraption the player can open it. Unfortunately something is wrong with the crank/pulley and the player has to figure out what it is. It turns out that a small  piece of wood has been jammed into one of the pulleys, making it impossible for the crank to pull the rope going through the pulley.<br /><br />This particular piece of wood took quite a lot of tweaking in order to make it noticeable. For each test session we found that there was always one or more testers that got stuck on this puzzle. They simply could not find what was wrong, most important, they did not notice the wooden piece at all. Over and over we tweaked the puzzle, we added descriptions and interaction messages, we changed the texture of the wooden piece, we added some faint light to show it clearer in the dark, there are some particles coming down from the wooden piece when you pull the crank, we made the model larger and we changed the angle it is stuck in. We even added an alternative solution to the original solution (not saying what the solutions are, in-case you like to solve the puzzle in another way than what is shown in the video).<br /><br />Finally, we hope, for the love of all puzzles, that this puzzle has been tweaked to perfection and that none of you will get stuck on it*.<br /><br /><br /><font style=\"font-style: italic;\" size=\"2\">*If you watch this video, it would be very strange if you did. :)</font><div class=\"blogger-post-footer\"><img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/9193968969153274146-1675767323154088354?l=frictionalgames.blogspot.com' alt='' /></div>") (link ((rel .

"html")) "Since you people were nice enough to help us reach 2000 pre-orders of <a href=\"http://amnesiagame.com/\">Amnesia: The Dark Descent</a> earlier this year, we have been forced to record some commentary. This was not something that we had done before, but thought that it would be a really simple task. As always, it turned out to be a lot more trouble than we had first assumed.<br /><br /><br /><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">Adding Commentary to the Game</span><br />Our design was inspired from the kind of commentary that can be seen in the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Half-Life_2\">Half-life 2</a> episodes and <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Chronicles_of_Riddick:_Escape_from_Butcher_Bay\">Riddick: Escape from Butcher bay</a>. Essentially, it consists of icons that are scattered throughout the levels and when interacted with you hear a developer ranting. I first just wanted to have some kind of text-billboard that you could click on and that was it. Simple and Effective.<br /><br />Then Marc, one the artists here at FG, put a really nice looking model instead. Now that we had a nice model we of course wanted more! So decided on giving it some kind of nice gold shader and started to experiment with this. We went through various versions, but it did not turn out that well. Unfortunately we could not have the gold shader as it was not visible enough in dark areas (something Amnesia is filled with) and we went with a more flat-shaded-thingie, that made it stand out more, instead.  Now I also felt forced to add some effects to this and put an hour or two into making a part of the icon spin and radiate some \"Waves\" (that Marc made) when activated.<br /><br /><div style=\"text-align: center;\"><a onblur=\"try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}\" href=\"http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_QfesHslH-uc/THvPJgtvbQI/AAAAAAAAANM/CpDHtXz7BRo/s1600/commentary_icon_ingame.jpg\"><img style=\"margin: 0px auto 10px; display: block; text-align: center; cursor: pointer; width: 400px; height: 191px;\" src=\"http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_QfesHslH-uc/THvPJgtvbQI/AAAAAAAAANM/CpDHtXz7BRo/s400/commentary_icon_ingame.jpg\" alt=\"\" id=\"BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5511226331325492482\" border=\"0\" /></a><span style=\"font-style: italic;font-size:85%;\" >Final icon design when crosshair is over it.</span><br /></div><br />Now, further complications happened.  When playing commentaries, they could be drowned out by other sounds, so we had to find ways to lower this \"background noise\". Some of the functionality for this already existed, but a few new effects had to be added before it worked like it should. In the final version all background sounds/voices are faded out and the commentary is faded in on top of that. It actually turned out quite nicer than I thought it would and makes it extra fun to listen to the commentaries!<br /><br />So that is how something I thought would take 5 minutes, ended up taking a full day.<br /><br /><br /><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">Recording Commentary</span> <span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">Voices</span><br />Before recording could be begin we had to find a some interesting stuff to talk about and this was not always that easy. We wanted the commentary rants to be short, connected to where the icon was and not require images or similar. So there was a bit of discussion on what to talk about. When that was done everybody were to write scripts and to read from these when talking. We had set a Monday as \"recording day\" and assigned all day to fix the recordings.<br /><br />The first recording problem was getting the microphones ready. I sounded like a the captain of an airplane in mine and had to run down to town to buy a new one.  Others did not have stores nearby and had put their faith into Jens to do some sound magic. To make sure the voices where free of smacking sounds and similar, we used the old trick of putting socks on the microphones. A set up that looked quite stupid and when my girlfriend came home she thought I had gone crazy, sitting talking to a sock-puppet (after all the crunch-time I put in this was not that implausible and I was already talking to myself from time to time).<br /><div style=\"text-align: center;\">¨<a onblur=\"try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}\" href=\"http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_QfesHslH-uc/THvXIPsx_KI/AAAAAAAAANU/hlqH7Xrf3kk/s1600/marcs+studio.jpg\"><img style=\"margin: 0px auto 10px; display: block; text-align: center; cursor: pointer; width: 245px; height: 272px;\" src=\"http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_QfesHslH-uc/THvXIPsx_KI/AAAAAAAAANU/hlqH7Xrf3kk/s400/marcs+studio.jpg\" alt=\"\" id=\"BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5511235105671216290\" border=\"0\" /></a><span style=\"font-size:85%;\"><span style=\"font-style: italic;\">Marc's attempt at creating a sound studio</span></span><br /><br /><a onblur=\"try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}\" href=\"http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_QfesHslH-uc/THvlpYKRCNI/AAAAAAAAANc/s6KtPVOse_8/s1600/luis+studio.jpg\"><img style=\"margin: 0px auto 10px; display: block; text-align: center; cursor: pointer; width: 317px; height: 183px;\" src=\"http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_QfesHslH-uc/THvlpYKRCNI/AAAAAAAAANc/s6KtPVOse_8/s400/luis+studio.jpg\" alt=\"\" id=\"BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5511251068040841426\" border=\"0\" /></a><span style=\"font-style: italic;font-size:85%;\" >..and here is Luis's (other rooms were too noisy)</span><br /><br /><div style=\"text-align: left;\">When the voices in the microphones finally sounded good, only the actual talking was left. This was of course not easy at all. I think we all learned to appreciate the work our voice actors have made as we tried to talk make good commentary voices. There is so much to think about: Speak at the right range from mic, speak slowly, say the right words, do not spit into the microphone, do not make silly noises, avoid external interferences, etc. Whenever any of these errors popped up it was retake time. I think the last voices was recorded something like 1:00 in the night, after having started at 08:00 in the morning. Who stayed up that long will remain an internal secret.<br /><br /><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\"></span>Despite this rather strange workday, the voices actually turned out pretty nice. I know I do not sound perfect all the time, and there are some sound bytes, where you clearly hear I had not had water for a while and my voice sound like some deranged drunkard. I guess that is part of the fun though and most of the time we should be very  comprehensible.<br /><br /><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">Final results</span><br />To learn how me, slightly confused, talking to a sock sound like, and other fun stuff you will have to wait for the release of the game!

Often scenes that are extra emotional or involving are called \"cinematic\". I do not really like this word and its usage expose many of the problems videogames have today. I guess some explanation is required. My two major reasons for disliking the word are:<br /><br /><a onblur=\"try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}\" href=\"http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_QfesHslH-uc/THqXKUPS0QI/AAAAAAAAAM8/go4HP3ehkCM/s1600/_45483583_cinema512.jpg\"><img style=\"margin: 0px auto 10px; display: block; text-align: center; cursor: pointer; width: 320px; height: 180px;\" src=\"http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_QfesHslH-uc/THqXKUPS0QI/AAAAAAAAAM8/go4HP3ehkCM/s320/_45483583_cinema512.jpg\" alt=\"\" id=\"BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5510883297528566018\" border=\"0\" /></a><br /><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">1) Movies are not rolemodels</span><br />It means that videogames should strive to be more like cinema, that there are really important lessons to be learned by doing things like \"in the movies\". There is so much done in games the past 20 years, based on cinema, that has kept videogames from evolving. Linear and strict plots being one of the biggest. Because movies rely so much on being extremely specific in what the viewer shall see, it has standards that are direct opposite of what a videogame is. By having these \"cinematic\" goals, we have gotten things like cut scenes where all the \"fun stuff\" happens, quick-time-events and annoying camera angles. Games would have been far better off if these things did not become the design standards they are today.<br /><br /><br /><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">2) Movies are not better</span><br />It implies that film is a superior medium. I would like to say that it is actually reverse. Film is probably the lesser of all story telling media. It leaves less to imagination and is the least fulfilling. Films do not require any real effort and leaves very little to the imagination. Sure, there are films that are hard to get and with very subtle imagery, but these are far between, and in my eyes does not live up the fantasies a great novel or piece of music can conjure up. In my mind games take all this a step further. While all other media gives us a prefabricated descriptions, videogames places us in living breathing worlds. I feel the difference is like reading about climbing Everest and actually doing it. Videogames as a medium is not inferior, I would say it is far superior than any else.<br /><br /><br />Does this means that the best games of today trump the best films, music and books? Far from it and quite the reverse. But videogames as a medium has an awesome potential. It would be very bad to let catchy buzz-words such as cinematic to stand in the way of fulfilling it.<div class=\"blogger-post-footer\"><img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/9193968969153274146-3253731995278668365?l=frictionalgames.blogspot.com' alt='' /></div>") (link ((rel .

What is left for us now to do is to send it away to our <a href=\"http://games.1c.ru/amnesia/\">Russian publisher</a> and online retailers.

Thinking that perhaps some of our pets had escaped, I became a bit worried and carefully entered our damp dwelling.<br /><br />Carrying a meat hook (someone forgot to tidy up last night?) I walked down to the cellar and saw that there was a mess at one of the table. There where also strange sounds coming from the cages and I had to use the cattle prod to calm the critters down. I counted them all twice and all stock seemed to be in place, allowing me to take a sigh of relief (we used to be six people in Frictional you know!).<br /><br />Then I noticed that some of our notes, parchments and scrolls where missing. A thief! I also found a match lying in the mud on the floor, confirming that (most likely) one of the many hobos had sneaked in. This kind of confused me though, since I thought they learned their lesson last time in a quite tentacular way. It was also strange that they would take papers; I was not aware that they could read (perhaps nature called?).<br /><br />Oh well. Now it is back to work, have some stuff to disect and refine.

What is left now is just a bit of polish and minor additions. This does not mean that all is good and we can just relax though. The game is still rough around the edges at places and require quite a bit of work. However, we no longer have to worry about getting new things into the game. Now we can just focus on what is already there and make it as nice as we can.<br /><br />It is quite astounding how far the game has gotten. We started out making the first proper content around two years ago, and since then the amount assets have just continued to grow. Looking through our project files I counted a total of:<br /><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">106</span> Music files<br /><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">1202</span> Model files<br /><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">1533</span> Texture files<br /><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">856</span> Sound files<br />This was just a very rough calculation though so I have surely missed a few. Also, there is still stuff left to add, so we are not done just yet!<br /><br />It is also worth noting that this does not mean that a demo will be out shortly. For that you have to wait a few more months I'm afraid. However, we have sent out previews to a few places and some first impressions have started to drop in:<br /><br /><a href=\"http://pc.ign.com/articles/109/1095676p1.html\">IGN thought</a> that <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">\"Amnesia could be the scariest survival horror game in quite a long time\"</span>.<br /><br /><a href=\"http://www.adventuregamers.com/article/id,1174/\">Adventure Gamers said</a>  <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">\"I can already assure horror fans that another unsettling, potentially-pants-peeing adventure awaits\"</span>.<br /><br /></div></div><a href=\"http://www.ripten.com/2010/06/19/amnesia-the-dark-descent-preview-brycew/\">Ripten pondered</a> if it <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">\"might just be Frictional Games’ best title\"</span>.<br /><br /><a href=\"http://gamerfill.com/node/266\">Gamer fill confessed that</a> <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">\"I had to (yes, had to) turn Amnesia off after a short hour of play, so as to give my nerves a rest\"</span>.<br /><br /><a href=\"http://www.tgdb.nl/computer/previews/9036-preview-amnesia-the-dark-descent.html\">TGDB said</a> <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">\"Het spel zou best wel eens één van de engste survival horror games in tijden kunnen zijn\"</span>. Which I am not sure exactly what it means, but according to babel fish it was quite positive!<br /><br />To hear things like this from an early preview (consisting of around the first 1/3 of the game) is extremely motivating and makes us very happy. Now we just need to make sure the full game delivers as well! More previews should pop up now that E3 is over, and be advised that they might contain spoilers.<br /><br />Thanks to all who have supported us so far! We are very close* to a finished game now!<br /><br /><span style=\"font-size:78%;\"><span style=\"font-style: italic;\">*An offical release date may or may not be announced next week.</span></span><div class=\"blogger-post-footer\"><img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/9193968969153274146-4360989549236341923?l=frictionalgames.blogspot.com' alt='' /></div>") (link ((rel .

At the same time it is also a sort of explanation of the core design goals for <a href=\"http://www.frictionalgames.com/\">Frictional Games</a>. It is not meant to describe how to do things, instead it as attempt to describe how we want our videogame experiences to be like.<br /><br /><a onblur=\"try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}\" href=\"http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_QfesHslH-uc/S_kbrLKZlpI/AAAAAAAAAMk/q-yeiJjNptE/s1600/water+mill.jpg\"><img style=\"margin: 0px auto 10px; display: block; text-align: center; cursor: pointer; width: 347px; height: 235px;\" src=\"http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_QfesHslH-uc/S_kbrLKZlpI/AAAAAAAAAMk/q-yeiJjNptE/s320/water+mill.jpg\" alt=\"\" id=\"BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5474437250590283410\" border=\"0\" /></a><br />When reading a good book, I get drawn into its world and feel part of the events that unfold. Yet the happenings are just figments of my imagination. There is a one way feed of information and I have no choice of where to focus; the writer is my guide and points out details to explore and choses what path to take. Still I feel immersed in the environments and close to the characters, evoking powerful emotions inside me. To be part of this journey through engrossing and enriching worlds is one of the major enjoyments for me when reading books. When a piece of fiction really hooks me, it is an awesome experience and I truly feel like I am inside the fictional world.<br /><br />Still, I am not there, the environment does not kick back, only existing as a stream of prefabricated perception that I tap into. When making a video game, we can take a step further and create something that in a sense is truly there. Something that I can see through my own eyes, letting me decide where and how to explore. This is extremely potent stuff and something that requires attention. The opportunity to create alternative realties lie at our fingertips, yet it seems to be that the chance is not taken. Instead of focusing on world building and emotions, the realities inside  videogames are wrapped in abstract rule systems where the environmental experience is secondary to the core rules and competitive elements.<br /><br /><a onblur=\"try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}\" href=\"http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_QfesHslH-uc/S_gL_GcIaZI/AAAAAAAAAMc/bihmxoyx1z0/s1600/Mountains_of_Madness.jpg\"><img style=\"margin: 0pt 10px 10px 0pt; float: left; cursor: pointer; width: 240px; height: 320px;\" src=\"http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_QfesHslH-uc/S_gL_GcIaZI/AAAAAAAAAMc/bihmxoyx1z0/s320/Mountains_of_Madness.jpg\" alt=\"\" id=\"BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5474138525757106578\" border=\"0\" /></a>Some games do touch upon this kind of creation of realities, but is almost always bogged down by game rules that destroy the \"living in a world\"-experience in some manner. For example, I thought that the first part of <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BioShock\">Bioshock </a>(and some later parts) where you could just go around and explore the locations where amazing. Sometimes I truly felt part of the great underground city. Sadly, most of the game was filled competitive combat sections, spoiling much of the experience for me. Other games, like <a href=\"http://www.tension-game.com/\">The Void</a>, have an intriguing premise and imaginative environments, but holds me back with very punishing gameplay making it very hard for me to immerse myself in the game's world. Many adventure game also suffer from this and include, many times obscure, puzzles that halt progress and pulls me out of the game's world.<br /><br />Of course videogames with very game-like rule sets are not bad, they can be very rewarding and should not cease to exist. I love solving puzzle and trying to overcome unforgiving platform sections. But sometimes, I just want to be immersed in another world, explore and be part of an engaging experience. However, almost always when I try a game where I think I will get this, I am put inside a competition with me against a the computer/designer. This does not mean that all challenge should be removed, as encountering obstacles can be helpful for immersion in the world, but it should not be the focus when making an alternative reality. It is also worth noting that I am not after being spoon fed a story, but a videogame where engaging (let it be sad, fun, disturbing, etc) experience in a fictional realm is the main goal.<br /><br />Sadly, these kind of games are few, to the point of not really existing. Instead, almost all videogames have as a core goal to challenge the player, and to be something that is meant to be beaten. I would like to see more games where the main goal is to make the player live an experience, to engage the player in a world and to evoke a wide range of emotions. I would like to start a game and be taken to another world, where I can focus on being immersed in an alternate reality instead of worrying about headshots, experience points or the solution to a sliding puzzle.<br /><br />To make the player become part of a fictional world has been a goal for us at Frictional Games since we started working on <a href=\"http://www.penumbragame.com/\">Penumbra </a>and it is still our main goal when creating <a href=\"http://amnesiagame.com/\">Amnesia: The Dark Descent</a>. We know we still have a lot left to learn and are stuck in many traditional game conventions. But we make sure to try out new things, noticing what works and what doesn't as we go along. Hopefully this will take us increasingly closer to the goal of making an experience that is not <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">played</span> but <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">lived</span>.<div class=\"blogger-post-footer\"><img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/9193968969153274146-1653066088064668650?l=frictionalgames.blogspot.com' alt='' /></div>") (link ((rel .

It plays like a usual point-and-click but with some fun twists. Unfortunately the game suffers from some annoying puzzle design, but is still worth trying out.

He has the same dense, but yet enthralling, prose and an incredible ability of making monsters. The books takes place in a fantasy world, but even though it is very weird, it feels in real in a way. Prepare for some really disturbing imagery.<br /><br /><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stiff:_The_Curious_Lives_of_Human_Cadavers\">Stiff: The Curious Lives of Human Cadavers</a><br />Ever wondered what happens to human bodies after they die?

He has the same dense, but yet enthralling, prose and an incredible ability of making monsters. The books takes place in a fantasy world, but even though it is very weird, it feels in real in a way. Prepare for some really disturbing imagery.<br /><br /><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stiff:_The_Curious_Lives_of_Human_Cadavers\">Stiff: The Curious Lives of Human Cadavers</a><br />Ever wondered what happens to human bodies after they die? This book contains all you want to know and then some. It opens up with describing rows of heads lying in bowls (to be used in educational purpose) and then gets worse. For anybody interested for anybody interested in the macabre this is a must.<br /><br /><span style=\"font-size:180%;\"><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\"><br /></span></span><div style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style=\"font-size:180%;\"><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">Your tips?</span></span><br /></div>Please leave any nice Halloween tips you might have in the comments!<div class=\"blogger-post-footer\"><img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/9193968969153274146-3879859397175243270?l=frictionalgames.blogspot.com' alt='' /></div>") (link ((rel .

The results that I got where pretty interesting, so thought I might as well share them. Also note that this post might be a bit more technical than the previous.<br /><br />The good thing with these renderers is that they both share the basic material data. So I can use the same data for both HPl2 and HPl3. HPL3 comes with the few more features for decals but for tests, it is easy to just skip them.  When setting up the test I went with a very simple scene, it just the same box model rendered several times, a floor and lights. Some times it is best to test with proper game scenes, but I wanted to something that could be easily tweaked and gave simpler output. This means that the tests are not 100% accurate of in-game performance, but even testing a level in game is not that, as framerate varies a lot depending on where in a level one looks. So usually benchmarking has some kind of fly-through, but that is of the scope from what I intended to do.<br /><br />Note that HPl2 test was built in Visual Studio 2003, while HPL3 uses the 2010 version. I do not think this should matter much though, even if the optimization routines differ, simply because pretty much all of the work is done on the GPU. The graphics card I did all my testing on is a Radeon 5850 HD (and others where tried for some tests). And as a final note, all of the data is given as average frame time (in milliseconds!) and not as frames per second. As <a href=\"http://www.humus.name/index.php?page=News&amp;ID=279\">Emil Persson points out</a>, FPS is not a very good way to compare performance.<br /><br /><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">Test #1</span><br />Now with my setup details out of the way, let's get down to the details. I first started out with a scene like this:<br /><a href=\"http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_QfesHslH-uc/TMGdg-Sx6II/AAAAAAAAAQE/3gqFaULPqw4/s1600/Screen_Simple3D_000.jpg\"><img style=\"display: block; margin: 0px auto 10px; text-align: center; cursor: pointer; width: 260px; height: 196px;\" src=\"http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_QfesHslH-uc/TMGdg-Sx6II/AAAAAAAAAQE/3gqFaULPqw4/s400/Screen_Simple3D_000.jpg\" alt=\"\" id=\"BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5530875007190820994\" border=\"0\" /></a><span style=\"font-style: italic;\">1 x box, xz-plane floor, 1x spot light + shadow</span><br />which game me the following results:<br />HPL2: 0.78ms<br />HPL3: 0.84ms<br />Difference: +7.7%<br />This means, that given a simple scene like this the old renderer is actually faster! This is not that strange though since the scene does not have many lit screen pixels, most of the image being sky. Thus, the extra pass extra made with the pre-pass renderer matters more than an lighting speed-ups. Also, the decrease in draw buffer (3 to 2) in the g-buffer does not make up for the extra pass.<br /><br /><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">Test #2</span><br /><span style=\"font-style: italic;\">4000 x boxes, 1 x point light, x-z plane floor</span><br />HPL2: 14.9  <br />HPL3: 18.5<br />Difference: +24%<br />As expected when there is a lot of things to render, the pre-pass lighting is even slower. That extra pass shows on the performance. Remember though that 4000 objects is quite much and an important thing for good performance on GPUs is to have as few draw calls as possible.<br /><br /><br /><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">Test #3</span><br /><span style=\"font-style: italic;\">1 x boxes, 1000 x point light, x-z plane floor</span><br />HPL2: 30.0<br />HPL3: 29.2<br />Difference: -2.7%<br />As noticed, once the scene is filled with lights, pre-pass lighting is faster, but only so by a slight amount. Especially considering the large amount of lights. (I later realised that the actual lit screen pixels where quite few, something fixed later on in test #5).<br /><br /><br /><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">Test #4</span><br /><span style=\"font-style: italic;\">4000 x boxes, 1000 x point light, x-z plane floor</span><br />HPL2: 47.5<br />HPL3: 52.0<br />Difference: +10%<br />Doing a really stressful test (the number of lights and objects are really large) it seems like the old deferred renderer wins out. This was actually a bit unexpected and dissappointing to me as I thought that the pre-pass lighting should not be this far behind. But taking the little difference in test 3 into account, it is not that suprising. Still, after these tests it is clearly shown that pre-pass lighting is far from a giant speed up compared to deferred shading and it actually seems slower in most cases.<br /><br />I also tried to skip the early-z pass for pre-pass lighting (I use early-z in both renderers on all other tests). This is basically a pass where the z-buffer is set up, and makes sure later passes only draws visible pixels. From reading Crytech papers, it does not seem like the the Crysis 2 engine has this though (and same seems true for other engines), so I tried to do a quick and dirty test of not using it and got this data: 48.7 (+2.5%)<br />This means that even without the early z test, the pre-pass was still slower. However, I did not attempts to reduce overdraw (like sorting front to back) and it might be possible for optimizations here. However, when rendering front to back, there will be a lot more state switching as you cannot sort according to texture, etc as efficiently, so I wonder if the data might not even be worse in a more realistic scenario.<br /><br />I also tried this test out on a few other other cards (again with full early-z testing):<br />Geforce 240gt:  125, 137 (+9.6%)<br />Geforce 320M:  240, 240 (+/- 0%)<br />This gave the indication that on some cards pre-pass might actually be better, and that it might not be as clear-cut as the first tests seemed to show.<br /><br />As a final variation on this test, I added illumination maps to all textures, a feature that requires an extra pass in the old engine. I also removed the height map rendering. This gave me: 50.6, 50.0 (-1.2%)<br />This is a very tiny speed up considering that the methods now have the same amount of passes and that pre-pass lighting has faster light rendering and a smaller g-buffer.<br /><br /><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">Test #5</span><br /><span style=\"font-style: italic;\">488 x boxes, 30 x point light, x-z plane floor</span><br />Radeon 5850 HD:  7.4, 7.8 (+5.4%)<br />Geforce 240gt: 18, 19 (+5.5%)<br />Geforce 320M: 50.0, 45.5 (-9%)<br />Geforce 9800gtx: 9.5, 9.5 (0%)<br /><br />In this test I change to a more realistic number of lights and draw calls. I also aligned the lights so the lit pixels covered the entire screen, which I did not do above. As can be seen, on my computer (the 5850) deferred shading still wins, but on a less powerful card the pre-pass lighting is much faster. This difference might be a bandwidth issue and some cards might have problems pushing the data amounts required for deferred shading.<br /><br />I also did a tweak to this test and turned down the number of draw calls a bit:<br /><span style=\"font-style: italic;\">316x boxes, 30 x point light, x-z plane floor</span><br />Giving: 6.4, 6.6 (+3%)<br />This further reduced the difference and if I did the hackish removal of early z, pre-pass lighting plunged down to: 5,2 (-18%)<br />Even though this removal of early z is not very realistic, the results show that I need to investigate it. Something I will do once I get a more proper scene up and running.<br /><br />Finally, I also tried to give all the boxes illumination (and turning back on early z test):<br />6.8, 6.6 (-2.9%)<br />This clearly shows how you get the illumination almost for free in pre-pass, and that it costs a bit more with the deferred shader. This is not surprising though, given that it requires an extra pass, but hints that further effects can be more efficiently implemented when using pre-pass lighting.<br /><br /><br /><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">Conclusions</span><br />The tests clearly show that my previous assumption that light rendering in pre-pass lighting would be much faster was incorrect. It is a bit faster, but only noticeable so when really stretching the limit and then only by a small fraction. This makes me conclude that one should not use pre-pass lighting to have faster light rendering. However, as can be seen on the test with the Geforce 320M, the pre-pass lighting technique matters a lot more on older hardware, and it might actually be of greater use there.<br /><br />There is not any vast differences in the techniques though and instead the choice should be based on other merits. Given that pre-pass lighting allows for so much more variety in materials, I will keep it for HPL3, but I will not be expecting any rises in framerate anymore.<br /><br />I hope this post will prove useful for those who are thinking of using either rendering method, and for the rest it might be an interesting insight on how testing is done (at least how I do it).

"72"))) (thr:total nil "8"))) ("Tech Feature: Pre-pass lighting" "Progress on the new engine, HPL3, is coming along nicely and recently I changed the core rendering system into something called Pre-pass lighting. This switch has been made for a number of reasons, but before I got into that and what pre-pass lighting exactly is, I need to explain how we did it back in the \"old days\".<br /><br /><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">Forward Rendering</span><br />The engine powering Penumbra (HPL1) uses something called forward rendering. This type of rendering works by rendering the entire scene on an object basis. So when rendering a chair, wall, or any geometry in the world, this was done by drawing it one time for every light that touches it. So an object that is lit by three lights has to be drawn three times, and so on. This technique can be quite limiting when setting up scenes as you need to be very careful when adding lights. It might not actually be clear exactly how much impact on performance a single light will have and levels usually require quite some tweaking to get right. The complexity of a scene can be expressed as:<br /><span style=\"font-style: italic;\"><br />Draw calls = Objects * Lights</span><br /><br />This means that the number of draw calls can easily get very large and only adding a single light, even if it has little effect on the scene visually, can have very negative effects on performance.<br /><br /><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">Deferred Shading</span><br />When starting work on HPL2 (which was used for Amnesia) I wanted to get away from this annoying light limitations. Since HPL1 had been created a new technique called \"Deferred shading\" had emerged and when work on HPl2 was started, the average PC system was up for the the task.<br /><br />What makes deferred shading special is that it separates rendering objects and rendering the lighting. This works by first rendering to a special G-buffer that contains information such as normals, depth and color of all on screen objects.  The final output looks like this:<br /><br /><a href=\"http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_QfesHslH-uc/TMAHeDduksI/AAAAAAAAAPs/M8i7J6UDJxE/s1600/deferred_gbuffer.jpg\"><img style=\"display: block; margin: 0px auto 10px; text-align: center; cursor: pointer; width: 518px; height: 130px;\" src=\"http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_QfesHslH-uc/TMAHeDduksI/AAAAAAAAAPs/M8i7J6UDJxE/s400/deferred_gbuffer.jpg\" alt=\"\" id=\"BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5530428555318432450\" border=\"0\" /></a><br />From left to right: Color, normals and depth. Note that these texture have 4 channels each and not visible are also saved specular intensity and power. These three texture then represent the properties of all visible data. It is then used by the lights to render the final image. This makes the complexity of the rendering:<br /><br /><span style=\"font-style: italic;\">Draw calls = Objects + Lights</span><br /><br />This is a lot nicer and as lights and objects are separated, it is a lot easier to add lights to a scene without worrying about performance hits. It is also much simpler to intuitively  understand how performance will be affected.

I was interested in the tech back then since it made light rendering go faster, something that had proved a bit of a bottle neck in Amnesia. However, I did not have time back then and decided against it.<br /><br />As I started to update the engine to HPL3 I again looked at this technology. This time more had been written on the subject and it had actually been tested. For example a similar algorithm was used in Insomniac's Reistance 2 and Crytech goes over it in a paper about CryEngine 2. This also meant that the method was practical, and was well worth trying (I usually try and use tech I have been able to try in other games, as tech dead-ends can prove quite expensive).<br /><br />Pre-pass lighting (or deferred lighting as it is called sometimes) is very similar to deferred shading and I could use much of the code from HPl2 when implementing it. Only a few changes in materials and light rendering was really needed. The rendering works by also first rendering to a G-buffer, but one only containing normal, depth and specular power. After that lights are rendered, but they render only part of the light equation; basically color and specular intensity. Then in a final pass all objects are rendered again and the light data from the previous pass is used to render the final image. The sequence is like this:<br /><span style=\"font-style: italic;\"><br />Render Normals+Depth -> Render Lights  -> Render final image</span><br /><br />The first good thing is that this technique is able to render lights faster, since each lights has to do less equations and access less textures. The algorithm also includes an extra step at the end, but this does not matter that much, as the added the final render takes is regained by the one less buffer needed to be rendered to in the first g-buffer pass (only 2 textures needed instead of the 3 deferred shading uses).<br /><br />This speed up was not the main reason why I used it though. Since each object rendered again during the final pass, it is possible to have a much larger variety of material types. Instead of being confined to using what can be fitted into a g-buffer, a material can do specific calculations the final image pass. This allows for specialized skin shaders and other tricks. For example, it is now possible to have more features packed into the decal materials:<br /><br /><a href=\"http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_QfesHslH-uc/TMBL-eUfhnI/AAAAAAAAAP8/GJb3oVRz010/s1600/decal.jpg\"><img style=\"display: block; margin: 0px auto 10px; text-align: center; cursor: pointer; width: 362px; height: 287px;\" src=\"http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_QfesHslH-uc/TMBL-eUfhnI/AAAAAAAAAP8/GJb3oVRz010/s400/decal.jpg\" alt=\"\" id=\"BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5530503879073957490\" border=\"0\" /></a>Above  is a decal with both color, normalmap and height map, something not possible in the previous engine.

"text")) "Tech Feature: Pre-pass lighting") (content ((type . "html")) "Progress on the new engine, HPL3, is coming along nicely and recently I changed the core rendering system into something called Pre-pass lighting. This switch has been made for a number of reasons, but before I got into that and what pre-pass lighting exactly is, I need to explain how we did it back in the \"old days\".<br /><br /><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">Forward Rendering</span><br />The engine powering Penumbra (HPL1) uses something called forward rendering. This type of rendering works by rendering the entire scene on an object basis. So when rendering a chair, wall, or any geometry in the world, this was done by drawing it one time for every light that touches it. So an object that is lit by three lights has to be drawn three times, and so on. This technique can be quite limiting when setting up scenes as you need to be very careful when adding lights. It might not actually be clear exactly how much impact on performance a single light will have and levels usually require quite some tweaking to get right. The complexity of a scene can be expressed as:<br /><span style=\"font-style: italic;\"><br />Draw calls = Objects * Lights</span><br /><br />This means that the number of draw calls can easily get very large and only adding a single light, even if it has little effect on the scene visually, can have very negative effects on performance.<br /><br /><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">Deferred Shading</span><br />When starting work on HPL2 (which was used for Amnesia) I wanted to get away from this annoying light limitations. Since HPL1 had been created a new technique called \"Deferred shading\" had emerged and when work on HPl2 was started, the average PC system was up for the the task.<br /><br />What makes deferred shading special is that it separates rendering objects and rendering the lighting. This works by first rendering to a special G-buffer that contains information such as normals, depth and color of all on screen objects.  The final output looks like this:<br /><br /><a href=\"http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_QfesHslH-uc/TMAHeDduksI/AAAAAAAAAPs/M8i7J6UDJxE/s1600/deferred_gbuffer.jpg\"><img style=\"display: block; margin: 0px auto 10px; text-align: center; cursor: pointer; width: 518px; height: 130px;\" src=\"http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_QfesHslH-uc/TMAHeDduksI/AAAAAAAAAPs/M8i7J6UDJxE/s400/deferred_gbuffer.jpg\" alt=\"\" id=\"BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5530428555318432450\" border=\"0\" /></a><br />From left to right: Color, normals and depth. Note that these texture have 4 channels each and not visible are also saved specular intensity and power. These three texture then represent the properties of all visible data. It is then used by the lights to render the final image. This makes the complexity of the rendering:<br /><br /><span style=\"font-style: italic;\">Draw calls = Objects + Lights</span><br /><br />This is a lot nicer and as lights and objects are separated, it is a lot easier to add lights to a scene without worrying about performance hits. It is also much simpler to intuitively  understand how performance will be affected. By using this technique we where able to use a lot more light sources in Amnesia and considering all of the dynamic lights needed for the mechanics, the game would have been a lot harder to make using forward rendering<span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">.<br /><br /></span>Deferred rendering is not without problems though.

This feature is global sunlight along with shadows, a feature not implemented previously.  And since it is now implemented you can bet it will an important feature for the secret game ;)<br /><br />First up was making the Ambient light nicer. Below is screenshot of how it looks in HPL2:<br /><a href=\"http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_QfesHslH-uc/TLXWBwY4RII/AAAAAAAAAO0/OYDdXlXkCNA/s1600/bad_ambient.jpg\"><img style=\"display: block; margin: 0px auto 10px; text-align: center; cursor: pointer; width: 400px; height: 300px;\" src=\"http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_QfesHslH-uc/TLXWBwY4RII/AAAAAAAAAO0/OYDdXlXkCNA/s400/bad_ambient.jpg\" alt=\"\" id=\"BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5527559443324617858\" border=\"0\" /></a><br />This is just a uniform color blend that has been added and does not look very. It is quite hard to see any details when there is a uniform texture such as in the screenshot above. To get nice ambient lighting what you need to do is to somehow simulate global illumination. Light does not just hit an object and then stop, but bounces around and scatters color from nearby on each other. There is a lot of research into this and most of it require one to pre-calculate the result in one way or another.<br /><br />I settled with something really simple called hemispherical lighting, which basically mean to have separate up and down (sky and ground)  colors and then blend them depending on the normal of the  surface. My first idea was to use cubemaps to do something similar, but since the cubemap needs to be very blurred, using hemispherical lighting gave pretty much the same result and is a lot faster. Here is the result:<br /><a href=\"http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_QfesHslH-uc/TLXXftw1dRI/AAAAAAAAAO8/vmBfT1BXXNc/s1600/good_ambient.jpg\"><img style=\"display: block; margin: 0px auto 10px; text-align: center; cursor: pointer; width: 400px; height: 300px;\" src=\"http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_QfesHslH-uc/TLXXftw1dRI/AAAAAAAAAO8/vmBfT1BXXNc/s400/good_ambient.jpg\" alt=\"\" id=\"BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5527561057527493906\" border=\"0\" /></a>Now it is a lot easier to see details and looks a lot better.<br /><br />Next up was the direct lighting from the sun and this was quite simple. I could just add some tweak to the existing shaders and make it work. Basically sunlight is just like normal light but without any position or attenuation.  This means every pixel is lit from the same direction and strength is independent of distance to the  source (as it does not have a position).<br /><br />Here is how the scene looks when we add that too:<br /><a href=\"http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_QfesHslH-uc/TLXa1oW740I/AAAAAAAAAPE/Je0pJrchjNY/s1600/amb_and_sun.jpg\"><img style=\"display: block; margin: 0px auto 10px; text-align: center; cursor: pointer; width: 400px; height: 300px;\" src=\"http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_QfesHslH-uc/TLXa1oW740I/AAAAAAAAAPE/Je0pJrchjNY/s400/amb_and_sun.jpg\" alt=\"\" id=\"BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5527564732568691522\" border=\"0\" /></a><br />Much nicer, even though the texture is a bit boring. Note that there now is specular because of the direct light from the sun.<br /><br />Finally, lets move on to the shadows! The engine already feature the basic shadow rendering though a technique called shadow maps. What is the big problem now is to make it look good over long distances. Since shadow mapping works by rendering from the light's point of view, doing shadows from an omnipresent light source gets a bit complicated. The simple solution is to use a really large shadow map, but then you would get very bad resolution near the camera.<br /><br />What you do instead is to use the fact that objects take up smaller space of the screen the farther away they are. So the idea is to use the shadow map in such a way that you give more room for pixel nearby and less to those far away. This is something that has been researched quite a bit and there are various techniques to achieve this. One solution is to warp the projection when rendering to the shadow map. This comes with a lot of issues though and is very rarely used in games.<br /><br />Instead most games use a technique called <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">Cascaded Shadow Maps</span> or <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">Parallel Split Shadow Maps</span>. The way this works is that the view frustum (a geometrical shape encompassing all the camera sees) is split into several parts and a shadow map is given to each split. This means that the first split, which is right in front of the camera, gets a much larger shadow-per-pixel ratio than the last split, which is much larger, but further away (and hence has small on-screen pixels).<br /><br />The algorithm itself is pretty easy, especially since there is quite a few papers on it. The big problem is that you can get some flickering results because the shadow map can change a lot. There are published techniques that solve this fairly easy though. Most of my time was instead spent on making it work with the rest of the engine. This is something that might not be that known to non-programmers, but most of the work is often not in the algorithm itself but fitting it into the engine design.  I think I spend a 3-4 days on getting it inside the engine, before I had everything set up as it should. The actually algorithm took 2 days or so.<br /><br />Here is how it looks:<br /><a href=\"http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_QfesHslH-uc/TLXekV4u91I/AAAAAAAAAPM/VANXyzbye7k/s1600/shadows.jpg\"><img style=\"display: block; margin: 0px auto 10px; text-align: center; cursor: pointer; width: 400px; height: 300px;\" src=\"http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_QfesHslH-uc/TLXekV4u91I/AAAAAAAAAPM/VANXyzbye7k/s400/shadows.jpg\" alt=\"\" id=\"BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5527568833598912338\" border=\"0\" /></a>Note how shadows are detailed up front, yet they are cast all the way into the distance.<br /><br /><div style=\"text-align: left;\">Here is how the shadow maps look (I combine all into a single one):<br /><div style=\"text-align: center;\"><a style=\"font-style: italic;\" href=\"http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_QfesHslH-uc/TLXfLQtMRUI/AAAAAAAAAPU/sNdug9dOtUM/s1600/shadow_slices.jpg\"><img style=\"display: block; margin: 0px auto 10px; text-align: center; cursor: pointer; width: 388px; height: 96px;\" src=\"http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_QfesHslH-uc/TLXfLQtMRUI/AAAAAAAAAPU/sNdug9dOtUM/s400/shadow_slices.jpg\" alt=\"\" id=\"BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5527569502223222082\" border=\"0\" /></a><span style=\"font-style: italic;\">Probably  want to enlarge this by clicking!</span><br /></div></div><div style=\"text-align: center;\"><br /></div>These are the four shadow maps that all render shadows for different slices of the frustum.

Here is the result:<br /><a href=\"http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_QfesHslH-uc/TLXXftw1dRI/AAAAAAAAAO8/vmBfT1BXXNc/s1600/good_ambient.jpg\"><img style=\"display: block; margin: 0px auto 10px; text-align: center; cursor: pointer; width: 400px; height: 300px;\" src=\"http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_QfesHslH-uc/TLXXftw1dRI/AAAAAAAAAO8/vmBfT1BXXNc/s400/good_ambient.jpg\" alt=\"\" id=\"BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5527561057527493906\" border=\"0\" /></a>Now it is a lot easier to see details and looks a lot better.<br /><br />Next up was the direct lighting from the sun and this was quite simple. I could just add some tweak to the existing shaders and make it work. Basically sunlight is just like normal light but without any position or attenuation.  This means every pixel is lit from the same direction and strength is independent of distance to the  source (as it does not have a position).<br /><br />Here is how the scene looks when we add that too:<br /><a href=\"http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_QfesHslH-uc/TLXa1oW740I/AAAAAAAAAPE/Je0pJrchjNY/s1600/amb_and_sun.jpg\"><img style=\"display: block; margin: 0px auto 10px; text-align: center; cursor: pointer; width: 400px; height: 300px;\" src=\"http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_QfesHslH-uc/TLXa1oW740I/AAAAAAAAAPE/Je0pJrchjNY/s400/amb_and_sun.jpg\" alt=\"\" id=\"BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5527564732568691522\" border=\"0\" /></a><br />Much nicer, even though the texture is a bit boring. Note that there now is specular because of the direct light from the sun.<br /><br />Finally, lets move on to the shadows! The engine already feature the basic shadow rendering though a technique called shadow maps. What is the big problem now is to make it look good over long distances. Since shadow mapping works by rendering from the light's point of view, doing shadows from an omnipresent light source gets a bit complicated. The simple solution is to use a really large shadow map, but then you would get very bad resolution near the camera.<br /><br />What you do instead is to use the fact that objects take up smaller space of the screen the farther away they are. So the idea is to use the shadow map in such a way that you give more room for pixel nearby and less to those far away. This is something that has been researched quite a bit and there are various techniques to achieve this. One solution is to warp the projection when rendering to the shadow map. This comes with a lot of issues though and is very rarely used in games.<br /><br />Instead most games use a technique called <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">Cascaded Shadow Maps</span> or <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">Parallel Split Shadow Maps</span>. The way this works is that the view frustum (a geometrical shape encompassing all the camera sees) is split into several parts and a shadow map is given to each split. This means that the first split, which is right in front of the camera, gets a much larger shadow-per-pixel ratio than the last split, which is much larger, but further away (and hence has small on-screen pixels).<br /><br />The algorithm itself is pretty easy, especially since there is quite a few papers on it. The big problem is that you can get some flickering results because the shadow map can change a lot. There are published techniques that solve this fairly easy though. Most of my time was instead spent on making it work with the rest of the engine. This is something that might not be that known to non-programmers, but most of the work is often not in the algorithm itself but fitting it into the engine design.  I think I spend a 3-4 days on getting it inside the engine, before I had everything set up as it should. The actually algorithm took 2 days or so.<br /><br />Here is how it looks:<br /><a href=\"http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_QfesHslH-uc/TLXekV4u91I/AAAAAAAAAPM/VANXyzbye7k/s1600/shadows.jpg\"><img style=\"display: block; margin: 0px auto 10px; text-align: center; cursor: pointer; width: 400px; height: 300px;\" src=\"http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_QfesHslH-uc/TLXekV4u91I/AAAAAAAAAPM/VANXyzbye7k/s400/shadows.jpg\" alt=\"\" id=\"BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5527568833598912338\" border=\"0\" /></a>Note how shadows are detailed up front, yet they are cast all the way into the distance.<br /><br /><div style=\"text-align: left;\">Here is how the shadow maps look (I combine all into a single one):<br /><div style=\"text-align: center;\"><a style=\"font-style: italic;\" href=\"http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_QfesHslH-uc/TLXfLQtMRUI/AAAAAAAAAPU/sNdug9dOtUM/s1600/shadow_slices.jpg\"><img style=\"display: block; margin: 0px auto 10px; text-align: center; cursor: pointer; width: 388px; height: 96px;\" src=\"http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_QfesHslH-uc/TLXfLQtMRUI/AAAAAAAAAPU/sNdug9dOtUM/s400/shadow_slices.jpg\" alt=\"\" id=\"BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5527569502223222082\" border=\"0\" /></a><span style=\"font-style: italic;\">Probably  want to enlarge this by clicking!</span><br /></div></div><div style=\"text-align: center;\"><br /></div>These are the four shadow maps that all render shadows for different slices of the frustum.

For example: \"A princess is kidnapped; a  brave knight rides to save her; the knight faces a dragon, the knight slays dragon and saves the princess; finally the knight gets half the kingdom and marries the princess\". Most likely, one also thinks of even smaller details as integrated parts of the story; the way in which the princess is kidnapped, how the knight struggles against the dragon, and so on.<br /><br />This is not the right way to think of stories. The chain of events is just the <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">plot</span>, and it is a device used in order to get the story across to an audience. What really lies at the core of the story are themes, locations, emotions, and so on. Pretty much all stories we have heard in our lives have been plot-based, but this is because this has been pretty much the only way of telling them. Now that we have videogames as a widespread medium this is no longer true. Still, the idea that story equals plot remain strong. It is a common belief that when a game becomes less linear, it is less about the story. I do not think this is true and if we want to advance the storytelling of the medium,  this view needs to go.<br /><br /><br /><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">By the Campfire</span><br />Humans have been telling stories for a long, long time, well before the dawn of civilization. These stories were not written down, but spread by being told over and over, never repeated exactly the same way. These kind of \"camp fire stories\" still remain, traveling from person to person, constantly evolving and changing. Yet, while the way the stories are told change, in a way they still remain the same. Anyone who has ever told a story like this knows that you often never know the exact words. Instead, you know of certain important things the story is supposed to \"say\".<br /><br />It is very common that you change a story like this depending on your audience. If the people listening do not seem impressed by the hero's strength, you add more details,  more events, descriptions and dialog. Your goal when telling the story is not be give an exact replication of how the story was told to you. What you are trying to do is to copy the <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">impact </span>the story had on you and any change you can do in order to accomplish this is a valid one.<br /><br />The moment you do something like this, you have realized, although perhaps unconsciously, that the essence of the story its not the words that make it up. Instead, the story is about something on a higher level.<br /><br /><br /><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">Peeling an Onion</span><br />When a section of a story is trying to convince the audience how strong a hero is, it is something that exists above the words that make it up. Still, this \"strong hero\" theme, might not be at the highest level either and simply be a vessel for a yet greater goal. Perhaps it sets up an overarching theme of how even the strong will eventually fall. The levels might not stop even there and eventually the essence of the story might be boiled down to a few essentials. These essentials is what the story is <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">really</span> about. Remove any of these and the structure collapse and the original story is no more.<br /><br />It is also important to have in mind that some levels might be connected. Something that is at a higher level might not manage to stand on its own. A certain part of the story might be about the hero overcoming overwhelming odds and is meant to provoke sympathy. At the same time it is about the hero being subjected to torture and treated very badly by some people. If you remove the torture part, then what you have left is only two very fuzzy themes and not something that alone can build the story. Thus it is not always so that the important pieces of a story are all on the highest level, but they might spread out in a hierarchy. And while this might actually continue down to the very lowest level, it can only do so if removing the part destroys the story. It is not a way to justify that every single detail is essential.<br /><br />I think most people already have these layers in their mind when thinking up a story, but then along the way give great weight to the details on the lowest level. This is especially harmful when making games, something I will address shortly. First I must go over what I mean by the essence of a story.<br /><br /><br /><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">What is the Essence?</span><br />One might argue that a certain story is not possible to distill into a few high level concepts. It could be argued that a certain scene must be in a very specific way; that one cannot simply describe it as some flimsy themes. I think this happens if one thinks that the themes must be deep, thought provoking, artsy, or whatnot. This is not what I mean with the essence though and it can be any number of things.<br /><br />For example take the \"attack on the village\"-scene in the movie <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0093773/\">Predator</a>, something I am sure few people would call deep, thought-provoking or similar. What are the high level concepts here? Is it just be boiled down to \"mindless violence\", \"how the civilized world rapes nature\" or anything similarly pretentious? Not so. Instead its essence is things like the environment, the oppressing jungle; to have a team of sweaty super-humans storm a village, showing off destruction and gunfighting. At a higher level it is also meant to  be fun watching and must keep a certain distance to reality and stay away from certain things (like murdering of innocents) in order to keep the audience entertained.<br /><br />What I want to show here is that a story does not need to be have some kind of moral lesson, ask an existential question, or whatever deep meaning, at its core. It can be shallow and just for fun. Even so, there <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">is </span>an essence and it is what really matters in the story.<br /><br />Consider any good book/movie you have ever read/seen. Is it really the lowest level of events and details that made you like it? Was it not the locations it took you to? Was it not the interesting relationship between character? Or the way slowly uncovering a mystery made you feel? I argue that no story, no matter what sort, is not about the exact way in things happen, but about the essence of these events. This is something that is crucial to have in mind in video games, as simply nailing down a few details that satisfy the essence is not enough. A video game is a living, breathing world and the essence needs to be portrayed through the right use of the mechanics (such as gameplay, art, sound, etc).<br /><br /><br /><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">Stories in Videogames</span><br />Actually videogames already use this kind of story telling! For example, first person shooters have not set the exact sequence how people get shot or houses blown up. The thing that matters is that people <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">do</span> get shot and houses <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">do</span> get blown up. Exactly how this happens is not important for the story, only that the essence of the action stays the same.<br /><br />The same is true for portrayal of environments in most games. It does not matter how the protagonist traverse or interact with it, the designer simply constructs a world and the rest is up to the player. By setting up the mechanics of the game a certain way, the designer then pretty much guarantees that the player will have a specific kind of experience and that the essence is kept intact.<br /><br />However, this how far it goes in most the games today. Once a videogame gets to trickier parts of the story, lower level details are given more and more importance. When it comes to concepts like love, betrayal and grief, pretty much all current games rely on a specific set of events, a plot, to convey them. No longer does it consider the essence of the story. Instead, it becomes focused on the low-level details.  Take <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/God_of_War_%28video_game%29\">God of War</a> as an example. There is no need to have cut-scenes showing how angry and prone to violence Kratos is - the gameplay does this for us. But when it is time to bring up other emotions, like showing the reasons behind his rage, the game resorts to plot-based cut scenes.<br /><br />This does not have to be the case. I think that just about any essence can be expressed by a virtual world guiding the player using various mechanics. This can be conveyed just as good, or perhaps even better, than what a carefully planned plot is able to.   I believe we are already seeing this with deeper themes such as a fear. As has been proved by games like <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silent_Hill_%28video_game%29\">Silent Hill</a>*, over ten years ago, video games can be used to provoke fear in a way that is impossible to do in any other medium. While certain kinds of horror lends itself extremely well to the video game medium, I see no reason why other emotions and themes can not work just as well. There are of course also games like <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fallout_%28video_game%29\">Fallout</a> and <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shadow_of_the_Colossus\">Shadow of the Colossus</a> that touch upon other themes without using a plot, giving a glimpse of what could be achieved. However, this is just the tip of an iceberg and videogames as a story telling medium is still far from where it could be.<br /><br /><br /><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">End thoughts</span><br />Abandoning plot and a linear progression does not mean that one is creating a sandbox game. It simply means that one picks out the essence of the story and design  a virtual world that delivers just that. I believe that sticking to old fashion cut-scenes is a dead end if we want video game story telling to progress. Instead we need to look at a higher level, figure out the essence of our stories and focus on that. When this way of creating a story reaches into areas previously reserved to films and books, storytelling in game will be a force to truly reckon with.<br /><br /><br /><span style=\"font-style: italic;\">* A major inspiration for Silent Hill was the movie </span><a style=\"font-style: italic;\" href=\"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0099871/\">Jacob's ladder,</a><span style=\"font-style: italic;\"> and this serves as an excellent example of how to take the essence of a story and putting it in a different medium. Compare the movie's </span><a style=\"font-style: italic;\" href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ttcof7TQ-Mw\">hospital scene</a><span style=\"font-style: italic;\"> to the otherworld found in Silent Hill and you will find there is a remarkable keeping of its essence. The feeling of being trapped, the environment, the sound design, the uncertainty of what is real and even the style of music. Silent Hill shares very little in terms of low-level plot details with the movie, and yet they manage to be remarkably similar.</span><div class=\"blogger-post-footer\"><img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/9193968969153274146-3146634987607734663?l=frictionalgames.blogspot.com' alt='' /></div>" "http://frictionalgames.blogspot.com/feeds/3146634987607734663/comments/default" (19634 57371) old 5 nil nil ((id nil "tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-9193968969153274146.post-3146634987607734663") (published nil "2010-10-11T09:55:00.006+02:00") (updated nil "2010-10-11T11:59:55.501+02:00") (title ((type .

Instead, it becomes focused on the low-level details.  Take <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/God_of_War_%28video_game%29\">God of War</a> as an example. There is no need to have cut-scenes showing how angry and prone to violence Kratos is - the gameplay does this for us. But when it is time to bring up other emotions, like showing the reasons behind his rage, the game resorts to plot-based cut scenes.<br /><br />This does not have to be the case. I think that just about any essence can be expressed by a virtual world guiding the player using various mechanics. This can be conveyed just as good, or perhaps even better, than what a carefully planned plot is able to.   I believe we are already seeing this with deeper themes such as a fear. As has been proved by games like <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silent_Hill_%28video_game%29\">Silent Hill</a>*, over ten years ago, video games can be used to provoke fear in a way that is impossible to do in any other medium. While certain kinds of horror lends itself extremely well to the video game medium, I see no reason why other emotions and themes can not work just as well. There are of course also games like <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fallout_%28video_game%29\">Fallout</a> and <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shadow_of_the_Colossus\">Shadow of the Colossus</a> that touch upon other themes without using a plot, giving a glimpse of what could be achieved. However, this is just the tip of an iceberg and videogames as a story telling medium is still far from where it could be.<br /><br /><br /><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">End thoughts</span><br />Abandoning plot and a linear progression does not mean that one is creating a sandbox game. It simply means that one picks out the essence of the story and design  a virtual world that delivers just that. I believe that sticking to old fashion cut-scenes is a dead end if we want video game story telling to progress. Instead we need to look at a higher level, figure out the essence of our stories and focus on that. When this way of creating a story reaches into areas previously reserved to films and books, storytelling in game will be a force to truly reckon with.<br /><br /><br /><span style=\"font-style: italic;\">* A major inspiration for Silent Hill was the movie </span><a style=\"font-style: italic;\" href=\"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0099871/\">Jacob's ladder,</a><span style=\"font-style: italic;\"> and this serves as an excellent example of how to take the essence of a story and putting it in a different medium. Compare the movie's </span><a style=\"font-style: italic;\" href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ttcof7TQ-Mw\">hospital scene</a><span style=\"font-style: italic;\"> to the otherworld found in Silent Hill and you will find there is a remarkable keeping of its essence. The feeling of being trapped, the environment, the sound design, the uncertainty of what is real and even the style of music. Silent Hill shares very little in terms of low-level plot details with the movie, and yet they manage to be remarkably similar.</span><div class=\"blogger-post-footer\"><img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/9193968969153274146-3146634987607734663?l=frictionalgames.blogspot.com' alt='' /></div>") (link ((rel .

And since the <a href=\"http://frictionalgames.blogspot.com/2010/09/one-week-after-release-of-amnesia.html\">post on a week after release</a> was quite popular, we have decided to do a new overview on where we stand now. This time we will mainly focus on the sales and give some more accurate figures on how things have turned out for us.<br /><br /><br /><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">The big picture</span><br />So, with one month of data to analyze, how did things go? I think it can be summed up with: <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">Better than expected on all accounts</span>! As of today we have sold a total of 36, 000 units (including pre-orders, but excluding boxed sales in Russia), and our goal,  which would determine if we would continue or not, were 24,000. Having met and exceeded that goal already feels quite nice. Frictional Games will live to create another game!<br /><br />15,000 (41.7%) of all sales were in the form of pre-orders, which is quite significant. Part of the explanation for this is that there was a 20% discount during pre-orders and we also believe that people are more inclined to buy a pre-order. With perks such as Steam pre-loading, people seem to think it is worth putting up money before release. And since there is no pirate alternative to a pre-order, it is more likely that people will go through with the purchase (more on pirating later). In any case, pre-orders is probably something we will focus on more for our next title.<br /><br /><br /><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">Platform specifics</span><br />Gathering an exact percentage of sales for Linux turned out to be a bit complicated. Purchases made in our store gets all three platforms, which is the only place to get the Linux version. The total amount of sold units in our own store is about 5000. Since we can connect some of these sales with steam activations and similar, we can make a conservative estimate of 2500 Windows users, leaving 2500 left for Mac and Linux. And since this this is the only store for Linux users, we assume 70% of these are Linux. This means 1750 sold Linux units, or 5% of the total sales.<br /><br />Mac sales are a bit simpler to estimate, and given the estimates from above plus some other data, comes to about 8% of the total sales. The interesting bit here is that just taking the last week into account the amount of mac sales lie at about 12%. This probably means that the Mac market takes longer to penetrate and that Mac owners might be more likely to buy an \"old\" game. Unfortunately we do not have data regarding this for Linux, but assume something similar happens there.<br /><br /><br /><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">Media and user response</span><br />As we said in the <a href=\"http://frictionalgames.blogspot.com/2010/09/one-week-after-release-of-amnesia.html\">last post</a>, the response from the media and users have been overwhelming to say the least. Right now, we have 86% at <a href=\"http://www.metacritic.com/game/pc/amnesia-the-dark-descent/critic-reviews\">Metacritic</a>, 90% from users on <a href=\"http://www.gamespot.com/pc/adventure/amnesiathedarkdescent/players.html?tag=tabs%3Breviews\">Gamespot</a>, and so on. Considering it is a niche and story based game this feels extra nice (which, as Kieron Gillen <a href=\"http://www.rockpapershotgun.com/2010/09/29/i-am-the-mob-mafia-ii-subjectivity-and-story/\">points out on RPS</a>, usually get lower meta-scores). We could not be any happier than we are with this response.<br /><br />So how has this affected the sales? Well it is obviously impossible to say what we would have sold with worse grades, but what we can do is to see what correlations there are between positive reviews and spikes in sales.  It turns out there is pretty much none. The only correlation we managed to find was with combined release of the <a href=\"http://www.escapistmagazine.com/videos/view/zero-punctuation/2092-Amnesia-The-Dark-Descent\">Zero punctuation</a> and <a href=\"http://www.gamespot.com/pc/adventure/amnesiathedarkdescent/review.html\">Gamespot </a>reviews. These were out very close in time and almost quadrupled sales compared to the previous days before (about 150/day to 600/day). It even seems like this boost still remains.<br /><br />Apart from this example, it has not been possible to find any other correlations. Part of this is probably due to the noisy nature of the data; many reviews come out at the same time they overlap and it is not possible to discern individual contributions. However, when articles have been alone in time, there still have not been any noticeable spikes. One explanation is that it might be hard for people to find out where the game is bought, as our website is seldom mentioned in previews/reviews. This is especially true for the time before the pre-order became available at the major online retailers. Another explanation is that most reviews have more of a long term effect, instead of an instant sales boost. What this means is that reviews convince players that already know about the game to purchase it, instead of acting as a PR catalyst.<br /><br />What reviews does do is to make other publications find out about you. Getting a review in a high-status outlet have meant mails from many other publications and convinced other media folk that the game is worth writing about. Thus, as mentioned previously, good review help sales in a long term perspective.<br /><br /><br /><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">Pirating</span><br />Now it is time to discuss pirating and how this has affected us. First of all, it is quite easy to see that there are tons of torrents/shared files of Amnesia available. When we search the web to see if any news on Amnesia has popped up, almost 50% of the results go to a pirated version of the game. This is of course makes us sad, but it is also something one has to deal with when living in today's world. We are well aware that the same technology that allows pirating of our game, is the same that enabled us create the game in the first place. Without a fast Internet and a connected world we would never be able to work together or distribute our games. But this does not mean that we should just ignore piracy and it is important to figure out what kind of impact it has on us.<br /><br />As I have said, the sales have been above what we had expected, but compared to the response we have gotten it still feels kind of low. For example, the very hyped <a href=\"http://www.minecraft.net/\">Minecraft </a>has gotten <a href=\"http://m00d.net/minecraft/sales/\">more than ten times the sales</a> compared us. While being a vastly different game compared to Amnesia, there are some differences that are worth discussing. In terms of the amount of PR received, I would say that Minecraft is more well known, but Amnesia is not far behind. Google gives us two times the hits compared to them and a popular pirate site gives Minecraft double the distributors compared to us. We have gotten more reviews from popular outlets, Minecraft has gotten more viral-like PR. As I said, I think Minecraft has the upper hand here, but not by that much. Still, Minecraft has a over ten  times the sales compared to Amnesia, which is a huge difference.<br /><br />Our conclusion is that a large part of this is due to the lack of pirating in Minecraft compared to us. As I mentioned above, Minecraft has 10x the sales, but only 2x the torrent distributors. A Google search on the subject also turns up twice the hits for Amnesia. It seems like more people are pirating Amnesia and we think there are two main reasons for this. Both of them are related to the single-player nature of the experience.<br /><br />First of all, once you have played Amnesia there is little meaning to play again. A person pirating the game and finishing it has no real reason to go back. So even if a player likes it and determines that it is well worth paying for, there is no incentive to do so. It is quite common to read on forums that people have downloaded a pirated version and say that they will probably buy it later. The question here is how many actually does this? Even if you really liked the game and want to support the developers, it basically feels like money down the drain since you get nothing extra after paying. This is not the case for a game like Minecraft where more content is released all the time and the game is designed to be highly replayable (and darn it for that, damn time consumer!).<br /><br />The second reason is the lack of any proper protection. Not only does Amnesia not have any real protection from the start, there is almost no way for us to force people into buying ad-hoc. What we can do is to release patches, but this only affect people that have not been able to start the game, a small part of the user base. So once the game is out we are basically screwed and we can not do much to make people chose a legal over a pirated one. Minecraft requires a server connection and is constantly updated, effectively pushing people towards buying the legit version.<br /><br />So what to do about this? One way is to create different kinds of games, where we can implement these sort of things. But that just feels wrong. A developer should not design a game based on how it can be protected and doing so can only lead to bad things for our games (to avoid feeding potential flames; this is based on what we want to do with our games, not what we think of others who might do this). What we want to continue doing is to create single player games that try to evolve the way in which videogames tell stories and evoke emotions. Another option is to expand our horizons and try other platforms. This is what we are currently looking into. We do not know what this will mean as of yet,  but hopefully we can continue to expand platforms and not limit them.<br /><br /><br /><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">Our situation</span><br />So what does all this money talk mean for Frictional Games as a  company? The most positive news is that we have recouped all expenses from creating Amnesia. This is of course awesome, but it needs to be taken into account that we worked long days at a very low salary, using minimal expenses. Our next game will not be possible to do on a budget like that.<br /><br />For the team, it is now finally back to more normal salaries. This still means that we are paid below, or just at, minimum wage (there is not an actual minimum specified by law, we just mean according to standards) here in Sweden though. We have made some calculations and if we were to increase salaries to normal levels, our current earnings would only last for a year and a half at most. We estimate that it will take at least two years to complete our upcoming game and there are more expenses involved than salaries for the five team members (check the credits for Amnesia!). So right now, we have to stick to having low salaries and see how sales pan out.<br /><br />At the time of writing our daily sales are at around 350 units, but it fluctuates quite a bit and it is hard to see how it will be in the long term. I said in the <a href=\"http://frictionalgames.blogspot.com/2010/09/one-week-after-release-of-amnesia.html\">previous post</a> that the sales were dropping drastically, but this actually stopped a day or so after posting. Our hope is that it will end up at around 70 per day, as this means that the day-to-day sales would cover monthly salary costs. The money earned at launch could then be used for other expenses and perhaps help us reach more common wages. Very hard to say when a steady level will been reached though. For the Penumbra games it happened two weeks or so after release, but PR for Amnesia is still pouring in, so we assume at least another month.<br /><br /><br /><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">Final thoughts</span><br />Hopefully this post has give some kind of insight into sales for  a PC game and where Frictional Games stand now. We are really happy how Amnesia have turned out in all ways. While sales could have been better, people are still buying it and will hopefully continue to. If it stabilizes at a good level, things are looking very bright indeed.<br /><br />We also feel that we finally can leave Amnesia behind us and start focusing on our next project instead. As this will be our first project where we know from the start that we can finance it ourselves, it will be very interesting to see what can be done. In all our previous games, we have mostly rushed through the production. This is will be the first time we can take our time and make sure that all is the way we want it to.<br /><br />Exciting times lie ahead and we hope you all will follow us into the future as well!<div class=\"blogger-post-footer\"><img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/9193968969153274146-1669926905785388587?l=frictionalgames.blogspot.com' alt='' /></div>" "http://frictionalgames.blogspot.com/feeds/1669926905785388587/comments/default" (19636 57375) old 6 nil nil ((id nil "tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-9193968969153274146.post-1669926905785388587") (published nil "2010-10-08T09:15:00.003+02:00") (updated nil "2010-10-13T00:24:31.469+02:00") (title ((type .

So right now, we have to stick to having low salaries and see how sales pan out.<br /><br />At the time of writing our daily sales are at around 350 units, but it fluctuates quite a bit and it is hard to see how it will be in the long term. I said in the <a href=\"http://frictionalgames.blogspot.com/2010/09/one-week-after-release-of-amnesia.html\">previous post</a> that the sales were dropping drastically, but this actually stopped a day or so after posting. Our hope is that it will end up at around 70 per day, as this means that the day-to-day sales would cover monthly salary costs. The money earned at launch could then be used for other expenses and perhaps help us reach more common wages. Very hard to say when a steady level will been reached though. For the Penumbra games it happened two weeks or so after release, but PR for Amnesia is still pouring in, so we assume at least another month.<br /><br /><br /><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">Final thoughts</span><br />Hopefully this post has give some kind of insight into sales for  a PC game and where Frictional Games stand now. We are really happy how Amnesia have turned out in all ways. While sales could have been better, people are still buying it and will hopefully continue to. If it stabilizes at a good level, things are looking very bright indeed.<br /><br />We also feel that we finally can leave Amnesia behind us and start focusing on our next project instead. As this will be our first project where we know from the start that we can finance it ourselves, it will be very interesting to see what can be done. In all our previous games, we have mostly rushed through the production. This is will be the first time we can take our time and make sure that all is the way we want it to.<br /><br />Exciting times lie ahead and we hope you all will follow us into the future as well!<div class=\"blogger-post-footer\"><img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/9193968969153274146-1669926905785388587?l=frictionalgames.blogspot.com' alt='' /></div>") (link ((rel .

There is a a lot to say really, but I will try and be brief and only concentrate on the most important things.<br /><br /><br /><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">Making the game available</span><br />This was the first time that we have had a game that would be simultaneously released for six different stores on the same day, so we were a bit nervous on how that would go. To make sure that all stores had enough time we sent out the game more than a week before release. This seems to have worked and all the stores had the game available in time for release.<br /><br />Added to this, we also had a system for pre-order customers to get their download link, serial key and Steam key. Jens have tried this over a month before release and it was very well tested once released. The only problem was some mix up with keys and people loosing their mail, otherwise all went well.<br /><br />In summary, we are quite happy how the availability of the game turned out and we actually expected there to be more unknown factors popping up and make our lives harder.<br /><br /><br /><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">Press Response</span><br />We had already gotten a few previews and thought we had some idea where the reviews would land. However, reality turned out far beyond our expectations. There has some extremely positive response (as can be seen on the <a href=\"http://www.amnesiagame.com/\">game's page</a> and at <a href=\"http://www.metacritic.com/game/pc/amnesia-the-dark-descent/critic-reviews\">meta critic</a>) and we are extremely happy about this. From all the graded reviews so far, all but three have been 80+ (about half of these 90+) and interestingly two of the less positive ones had has a major complaint that there was too much horror in the game. Which in a way makes us happy as well...<br /><br />We have also been able to reach out to a lot of media, and most major sites have covered the game. A bit disappointingly, a few sites that reviewed and covered the <a href=\"http://penumbragame.com/\">Penumbra </a>games have not mentioned Amnesia. We assume this is because we no longer have a publisher and thus lack the proper channels. For the Penumbra games we handled very little of the marketing ourself and thus lacked email/contacts to many sites (we still tried to contact all media we could think of though).<br /><br /><br /><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">Player response</span><br />Like reviews, response from player has gone beyond our expectations. We noticed this first at the release of the demo. We were unsure of how interesting it would be, but it was received very well. Since then, the name Amnesia has spread like wildfire across the Internets. I think there have been more videos, discussions, etc released at the time of writing than we have accumulated for any of the Penumbra games.  It is also telling that the within 24 hours of release, pretty much all major secrets in the game was found out (it took much longer for the Penumbra games).<br /><br /><br /><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">Piracy</span><br />I think the most alarming thing was that the game was available as a pirated copy 24 hours or so before release. This kind of 0-day release can be quite hurtful, as otherwise paying customers might be  so anxious to play that they pirate and then forget to pay for it. Since we released the game online only, we were not expecting this and the source of the illegal copy was one of our review copies (with tracking info hacked away). We are not sure what to do about this in the future, but we will have to be more careful and perhaps not send out review copies to so many outlets.  It could have gone a lot worse though as a the first review copies (of early builds) were sent out almost a month before release.<br /><br /><br /><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">Sales</span><br />As many of you might already know Amnesia is a sort of make or break game for us. At the time of writing, we are very close to our \"all is good\"-goal, meaning that we are still in business (due to contractual stuff we cannot release any numbers right now)! However, there are a few \"buts\" to all this.<br /><br />The response we got from the game is a lot better than we expected, yet the sales are only \"good\" according to our, much more modest, expected response. This makes us wonder what sales we would have gotten if the response would have been more like what we thought it would be. If this is our time in the spotlight, then a lot less noticed game would probably put us out of business. As it looks now, we still have to be quite careful in budgeting our next game (although much less careful than what we had to be with Amnesia). We were hoping a really successful release would makes 100% unworried about finances, but that is not what has happened.<br /><br />Can we really judge sales from just one week? According to current graphs: yes we can. Even though reviews keep coming in from major outlets and we keep pushing out marketing material (videos, release of tools, etc) sales are dropping fast. Around 50% of our current earnings where made in less than a week and on pre-orders from before release. The sales where at the top during the last hour of the Steam 20% discount, and has since dropped almost exponentially, being pretty much halved each day. It will be really interesting to see at what level it pans out.<br /><br />This is of course not all the income we will make from the game, but is still a bit discouraging when comparing to recent XBLA releases and similar. So why is not sales higher? Piracy? People waiting for future massive discounted sales? Game too scary / niched? Right now we have not got a clue, but hopefully it will become clearer further on.<br /><br />Finally, as this was a multi-platform release, some preliminary sales distribution should be of interest. Around 90% was windows users, 5% Linux and 5% Mac. In defense of  Mac and Linux we did concentrate our marketing efforts on the Windows user base.<br /><br /><br /><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">Technical Issues</span><br />When releasing for PC, there is bound to be tons of technical problems, especially since we released for three different OS. So it is kinda surprising that it has not been that much. As with Penumbra, the number one problem has been OpenGL driver issues, something we unfortunately cannot control.<br /><br />The largest single issue is probably the problems the ATI X-series and below range of cards for Windows. I'd like to add that we had tried it on a 9600 for a Mac successfully, but on Windows it fails due to various issues. In a way this is a driver issue too, but I think it might be some piece of code that it simply dislikes and I am hoping to fix it for an upcoming patch.<br /><br />In general game issues, there have been less than expected too. There is the standard falling out of the map and physics messed up bugs, but less than we thought there would be. In-game crashes are also very few (most caused by some cache issues it seems), which is nice and we feel that the game is quite stable.<br /><br /><br /><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">Game feedback</span><br />There has been a ton of feedback for the game and we try to read and discuss most of it. Discussing in detail would take up too much space so I will just take up two points, that I found extra important.<br /><br />The main thing we will do for our next game is to skip any \"forced\" and incoherent mechanics. What I mean by this is puzzles that does not really make sense in the game world and break the immersion. An example would be the corpse-puzzle that forces the player to use very specific items to complete it. Trying to get rid of all these elements and further increase the feeling of being part of an actual world, will be one of our top priorities.<br /><br />One of the main themes of the game, was for the player to slowly regain lost memories and to make up their mind about Daniel (ie their past self).  While most still refer to the protagonist as \"Daniel\" (and not \"me\"), many players have really thought about the details discovered in a way we hoped. The game medium is so great for setting the audience at the center of the drama and force them to take a stance. It feels as if many people did this in Amnesia, and we hope to take this even further and on different subjects for future games.<br /><br /><br /><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">Final thoughts</span><br />On almost all fronts, we area extremely pleased with this release. It has in many ways exceeded our expectations and it makes all the hard work, pay cuts, etc worth it in the end.<br /><br />The most distressing thing is the sales though. Even though we are far from complaining, it feels like we do not have the financial security we would like to have, to truly be able to focus on making the best game possible. So what should we do? The things we have discussed include: Increase the cost of the game, doing a console port instead of Linux/Mac, do a less niche title and more. Now is too soon to make a decision though and we have to see how the coming weeks and months go.<br /><br />Finally, I know I say this a lot but we truly mean it: Thanks to all who have supported us by buying the game, spreading the word, and what not. We hope you all will continue supporting us in the future as well!

There is a a lot to say really, but I will try and be brief and only concentrate on the most important things.<br /><br /><br /><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">Making the game available</span><br />This was the first time that we have had a game that would be simultaneously released for six different stores on the same day, so we were a bit nervous on how that would go. To make sure that all stores had enough time we sent out the game more than a week before release. This seems to have worked and all the stores had the game available in time for release.<br /><br />Added to this, we also had a system for pre-order customers to get their download link, serial key and Steam key. Jens have tried this over a month before release and it was very well tested once released. The only problem was some mix up with keys and people loosing their mail, otherwise all went well.<br /><br />In summary, we are quite happy how the availability of the game turned out and we actually expected there to be more unknown factors popping up and make our lives harder.<br /><br /><br /><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">Press Response</span><br />We had already gotten a few previews and thought we had some idea where the reviews would land. However, reality turned out far beyond our expectations. There has some extremely positive response (as can be seen on the <a href=\"http://www.amnesiagame.com/\">game's page</a> and at <a href=\"http://www.metacritic.com/game/pc/amnesia-the-dark-descent/critic-reviews\">meta critic</a>) and we are extremely happy about this. From all the graded reviews so far, all but three have been 80+ (about half of these 90+) and interestingly two of the less positive ones had has a major complaint that there was too much horror in the game. Which in a way makes us happy as well...<br /><br />We have also been able to reach out to a lot of media, and most major sites have covered the game. A bit disappointingly, a few sites that reviewed and covered the <a href=\"http://penumbragame.com/\">Penumbra </a>games have not mentioned Amnesia. We assume this is because we no longer have a publisher and thus lack the proper channels. For the Penumbra games we handled very little of the marketing ourself and thus lacked email/contacts to many sites (we still tried to contact all media we could think of though).<br /><br /><br /><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">Player response</span><br />Like reviews, response from player has gone beyond our expectations. We noticed this first at the release of the demo. We were unsure of how interesting it would be, but it was received very well. Since then, the name Amnesia has spread like wildfire across the Internets. I think there have been more videos, discussions, etc released at the time of writing than we have accumulated for any of the Penumbra games.  It is also telling that the within 24 hours of release, pretty much all major secrets in the game was found out (it took much longer for the Penumbra games).<br /><br /><br /><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">Piracy</span><br />I think the most alarming thing was that the game was available as a pirated copy 24 hours or so before release. This kind of 0-day release can be quite hurtful, as otherwise paying customers might be  so anxious to play that they pirate and then forget to pay for it. Since we released the game online only, we were not expecting this and the source of the illegal copy was one of our review copies (with tracking info hacked away). We are not sure what to do about this in the future, but we will have to be more careful and perhaps not send out review copies to so many outlets.  It could have gone a lot worse though as a the first review copies (of early builds) were sent out almost a month before release.<br /><br /><br /><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">Sales</span><br />As many of you might already know Amnesia is a sort of make or break game for us.

I had an idea of starting the video with a <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Lynch\">lynchian </a>stare, that should set the mood for the rest of the trailer. My design process was then for me to lock myself inside a dark room, lie on the floor and mumble stuff while gesticulating in the air.<br /><br />I then showed the synopsis to Jens and when he had approved after some smaller changes, I set Marcus and Luis to work with recording.  I gave them descriptions on how I wanted the clips to be, they then recorded something, sent sample and I mostly told em tons of stuff to improve. It took a day and something like 5 - 50 retakes for each shot (one ended up not being used) to complete. We now had the clips!<br /><br />One clip was missing though: Some fancy logo animation! This we could not do ourselves so I started looking for a company to do it for us. This turned out much harder than I thought! First finding a company was a pain; all I ended up finding where wedding photographers and the like. Nothing what we needed obviously. After some work I manged to find 19 different companies and mailed em. Three replied! All of which where fully booked or on vacation of course. But from one company, whose staff was on holiday, we got a tip about <a href=\"http://atmospheres.co.uk/\">Atmospheres</a>, a UK company that ended up doing the animation. I think it ended up very nice! Especially given the time and resource limits we had to give the company.<br /><br />Jens now started working on the editing. This has caused us tons of trouble with all codecs and other crap that never works out as planned (blog post about it <a href=\"http://frictionalgames.blogspot.com/2009/12/video-editing-hell-linux-to-resuce.html\">here</a>), but Jens has started to master it now and is usually pretty quick. So he cut and mixed with the cut em together, which took half a day or so. I contributed with the graphics for the texts and some quote mining (a skill any dev needs to learn!). After some minor fixes, the editing was done!<br /><br />Finally was time for Jens to put sound on it. You see, in order to get nice sound you do not keep anything from the original clips, and add new sounds for all. Otherwise you get all kinds of cut off sounds between cuts. It ended up taking Jens over three days to complete this (and is why \"launch\" trailer is not on launch). The final project file contained 52 tracks, each track having hundreds of sound samples.<br /><br />Fun fact is that this process of design -> graphics -> editing (scripting) -> sounds is pretty much how we made levels in Amnesia!<br /><br />There you have the story! Lots a work for a little over two minutes.

I had an idea of starting the video with a <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Lynch\">lynchian </a>stare, that should set the mood for the rest of the trailer. My design process was then for me to lock myself inside a dark room, lie on the floor and mumble stuff while gesticulating in the air.<br /><br />I then showed the synopsis to Jens and when he had approved after some smaller changes, I set Marcus and Luis to work with recording.  I gave them descriptions on how I wanted the clips to be, they then recorded something, sent sample and I mostly told em tons of stuff to improve. It took a day and something like 5 - 50 retakes for each shot (one ended up not being used) to complete. We now had the clips!<br /><br />One clip was missing though: Some fancy logo animation! This we could not do ourselves so I started looking for a company to do it for us. This turned out much harder than I thought! First finding a company was a pain; all I ended up finding where wedding photographers and the like. Nothing what we needed obviously. After some work I manged to find 19 different companies and mailed em. Three replied! All of which where fully booked or on vacation of course. But from one company, whose staff was on holiday, we got a tip about <a href=\"http://atmospheres.co.uk/\">Atmospheres</a>, a UK company that ended up doing the animation. I think it ended up very nice! Especially given the time and resource limits we had to give the company.<br /><br />Jens now started working on the editing. This has caused us tons of trouble with all codecs and other crap that never works out as planned (blog post about it <a href=\"http://frictionalgames.blogspot.com/2009/12/video-editing-hell-linux-to-resuce.html\">here</a>), but Jens has started to master it now and is usually pretty quick. So he cut and mixed with the cut em together, which took half a day or so. I contributed with the graphics for the texts and some quote mining (a skill any dev needs to learn!). After some minor fixes, the editing was done!<br /><br />Finally was time for Jens to put sound on it. You see, in order to get nice sound you do not keep anything from the original clips, and add new sounds for all. Otherwise you get all kinds of cut off sounds between cuts. It ended up taking Jens over three days to complete this (and is why \"launch\" trailer is not on launch). The final project file contained 52 tracks, each track having hundreds of sound samples.<br /><br />Fun fact is that this process of design -> graphics -> editing (scripting) -> sounds is pretty much how we made levels in Amnesia!<br /><br />There you have the story! Lots a work for a little over two minutes. Hopefully it will lure someone into buying! :)<div class=\"blogger-post-footer\"><img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/9193968969153274146-1515104594388073716?l=frictionalgames.blogspot.com' alt='' /></div>") (link ((rel .

But is this really where <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">you </span>are? When immersed in the virtual world of a videogame, do you still feel that you are sitting on a chair or in a sofa, staring at the screen?<br /><br /><br /><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">An experiment</span><br />Before moving on, I would like you to consider a simple experiment. You can easily do it with the help of a friend if you got the right prop: a rubber hand. Put your own hand next to the rubber one on a table, and place a screen between them, shielding your own hand from view. Now ask your friend to stroke the fake and real hand at the same time, at the same place. Something strange will now happen. Your body image will change, and the rubber hand will become part of you. As your friend touch both hands, you will feel as if the feeling arise in the rubber one. All of a sudden, you will have made an external object, become part of your self!<br /><br />With this experiment in mind. The question of where <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">you </span>are becomes more interesting. When playing a game, where do you transport your self to? Does it depend on what the game is about and from what perspective it is played from?<br /><br />I think this is not only an interesting curiosity, but a very important part of the experience.  Identifying where the player is when playing, can be very useful. And even more crucial, being able to \"place\" the player correctly is a very useful skill.<br /><br /><br /><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">Spectator or something else?</span><br />Let's start simple and explore movies first. In movies there is no interaction, so surely you must be a spectator to every scene in a movie. A clear example of this, is when you see a horror movie and have one of those \"don't go in there!\"-moments. This clearly puts you in a spectator seat, treating the actor as a separate entity.<br /><br />However, things does not get so polarized in other situations. Consider a gruesome torture scene or similar. These can get almost unbearable to watch and blurs the line between yourself and the actor.  The reason why this is so is because of something called mirror neurons (<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0pwKzTRG5E\">here </a>is a good video on the subject). What these do is to make you copy emotions from other people, replicating some of their sensations. One could even argue that they expand yourself, no longer limiting it to your own body.<br /><br /><br /><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">Interaction added</span><br />Let's go back to games now. As we can see there are two forces at work: we can trick our brain into extending the body image and we have specialized neurons that copy other people's emotions. How these will affect us will depend on what type of videogame we are playing.<br /><br />One of the major differences between games today is the viewpoint, ie first or third person. Does this matter? First person places you inside a character, putting your viewpoint where it usually is. This increases the feeling of being the character. In third person, you are removed from reality, and look upon yourself as if in some kind of <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Out-of-body_experience\">OBE</a>. This might make one think first person is superior, however, this only applies to the sense of sight. Another important sense is the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proprioception\">proprioceptic </a>one, which keeps track of your different body parts. When in first person, you see at most a hand or two, while in third-person gives you a full body image to copy. Third person can also give your mirror-neurons more to work with, like facial expressions. So depending on the kind of actions you perform, first or third will have a different feeling of <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">being</span>.<br /><br />Also worth noting is how easily we shift between different states. For example, in Silent Hill 2, I feel very much connected to James when I run around town. Then when entering a cut-scene, I sort of float out of him and become distanced.  I am no longer in control of the character and no longer part of him. Then when controls comes back I once more float inside him and the virtual characters becomes an extension of my own body again. This kind of movement happen in just about all games.<br /><br /><br /><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">The roles we play</span><br />Now that we have explored how the self can shift position as we play a videogame, an interesting question arise: What is the player's role in these different positions? As videogames contain interaction; not only do you fee,l to various degrees, part of the on-screen character, you also control her/him/it.  What does this make the player? Some kind of puppet master? An devil/angel on the shoulder? And more importantly, can the role assumed, change how the game is played?<br /><br />In most games, you do not control all actions in a game, but mostly give general commands. You tell your character to jump, but not how much force to use and so on. You command a character to pick up an item, but have no control over any finer movements. This is not that far off from real life though, as most of your day-to-day movements are made without any conscious thought besides the thought of initiating them. This means that making a character jump by pressing a button gives you a very close connection. In these instances, you might feel like you <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">are</span> the character.<br /><br />However, not all games have this close connection. Consider an adventure game where you just pick a destination for the character or choose between prefabricated lines of dialog. What role does this give the player? Some kind of guardian angle - a guiding voice inside the protagonist's head? Does this change the way that the player think of the character and how to interact with the game? Perhaps this role-assignment distances the player emotionally from the game's protagonist?<br /><br />It is interesting that some games actually explicitly give the player a role. This is quite common in adventure games, where the protagonist might look at the player and directly address her.  Do developers really consider how this can affect the placement of the player's self? I must confess I have not thought about this until very recently and have not heard of many discussing it.<br /><br />I think it is very important to decide where the player is and what her role is. If this is not coherent than it might have a negative effect on how the player choose to interact with the game's world. If you know your role  in the game, it gets easier to be immersed in it and know how to behave. This does not mean that the assigned role and placement of self needs to be the same throughout, but that it must be consistent with what needs to be done. A simple example of when this goes wrong is quick-time-events during cut-scenes. This can be very confusing at first, as you have just gone from being the character (in normal play mode) and gone to spectator mode (when cut-scene is playing). All of sudden you are required to control the character, something that is not coherent with your current role.<br /><br />This shift in placement also explains why emotional moments can be hard to get right in cut-scenes. As you enter a cut scene you move over to \"spectator mode\" and all of a sudden you are no longer as connected to the character as before and do not care as much. JPRG:s like <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Final_Fantasy_VII\">Final Fantasy 7</a> have it easier here, as the normal gameplay is more close to a \"spectator mode\" and thus the difference is smaller when entering a cut-scene. Same goes for a game like Heavy Rain. An important thing to note here is that contrast in position seem to play a huge role. When there is a violent shift in the location of self, it is very noticeable and the emotional connections are lost.<br /><br />Finally, I also want to add that the same game, can have players assume very different roles to themselves. A good, although a bit extreme, example of this, is a recent <a href=\"http://www.gamasutra.com/view/feature/6100/a_journey_across_the_main_stream_.php\">Gamasutra article</a>, where the writer let his mother-in-law play the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sam_%26_Max_Save_the_World\">new Sam and Max</a>. The interesting part is that she did not release she could or <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">should </span>control the characters. She just assumed (probably from lessons learned from experiencing other media) that she should be in spectator mode. One should have this in mind when designing a game and  tutorials for it, and not just assume that a player knows what role they play.<br /><br /><br /><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">Our take on this</span><br />Location of self and the role of the player is something that I have not really thought about until we where developing Amnesia. I would therefore like to discuss how <a href=\"http://www.penumbragame.com/\">Penumbra</a> and <a href=\"http://amnesiagame.com/\">Amnesia: The Dark Descent</a> differ in this aspect. As a lot of thought have gone into making the player become the protagonist in Amnesia, it has had a different focus compared to Penumbra.<br /><br />In Penumbra, Philip narrated all the scenes, yet in normal gameplay the player very much was part of the character. As these narrations are very subtle, it gives a bit of schizophrenic impression. For example, at one point Philip comments that he does not like spiders upon seeing one scuttle by. What happens here is that we are forcing very specific emotions on the player who will either accept or reject them. If rejecting them, it means a large shift in the position of the self and Philip stops becoming a part of you. From being part of the world yourself, you are reduced to being a passenger inside Philip's head. As mentioned before, this contrast can be very bad for the immersion and the emotional connection.<br /><br />In Amnesia, our goal is for the player to become the protagonist. This is vital for the story and experience as a whole. Because of this, there are never any words spoken, and there are no Daniel-subjective comments. We hope that this will place the player's self inside the body of the protagonist, and to think about what \"I am doing\" and not what \"Daniel is doing\". Our hope is that when you encounter facts about Daniel's past, it feels like your own forgotten memories. I know this is not an easy thing, and I am not sure many players feel this way. There is also the issues of adding smaller cues like breathing and heartbeats. Since these are actions that are not totally under our control, it is not incoherent to force them onto the player, but only if the player accepts it. Judging from player comments so far, there are people on both sides and having it in is a bit risky (we are actually thinking of having them optional in the future because of this).<br /><br /><br /><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">End note</span><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">s</span><br />There is a lot more to explore,  but did not want to make an already long post longer. So consider this as just a discussion starter and a brief introduction on the subject.<br /><br /><br />Now I am really interested in hearing how you feel about this!

All help is really appreciated!<br /><br />Thanks for all support so far!<br /><br /><br />Now while you are downloading I would like to discuss some of the thoughts that when into this demo. Creating demos for adventure games is hard, and more so for horror ones, where build-up and foreshadowing is so crucial. In a more action oriented game, the purpose is simply to show of the game's main mechanics (shooting, matching blocks, etc). However, in an adventure game, there is no such mechanic and it is the more holistic parts, like story, mood, etc, that shapes the experience.<br /><br />There are other problems besides showing off the game in the best possible way. It is also important to not have too many spoilers, so when starting the full game the player should not know too much. There is of course also the sale angle, you want people to be eager to buy after playing the demo.<br /><br />It was clear at once that we needed to start from the beginning of the game. The opening is crucial for understanding the game's story and putting the player in the right mood.  The problem is that our opening is quite long. Amnesia is not very action filled from the start and slowly builds up the mood. We felt that it needed to be shorter in the demo, so player could get a grasp of the game quicker. To fix this, we remade the first level a bit, so crucial items and information are found a bit earlier.  This shortens the experience, but contains the essence.<br /><br />Then it was the problem of what to show next. We wanted the demo to contain creature encounters, but as these are too slowly built up in the full game, they did not fit the demo. So after completing the first level, the player is transported about 2 hours into the game, where more stuff happens. It was then possible to let the demo go on from there and then end with a little cliffhanger. This also worked well from a spoiler viewpoint as the maps are more about atmosphere and most events have already been shown in videos.<br /><br />To further give the demo a good feel of the full game, we made the sanity mechanic be a bit more aggressive. This means that if will be easier to reach an insane state of mind than during normal play. The fear of going insane is a crucial element, so we felt we had to show it off somehow.<br /><br />I think the demo represent the full game fairly well and contains most of its major features.

All help is really appreciated!<br /><br />Thanks for all support so far!<br /><br /><br />Now while you are downloading I would like to discuss some of the thoughts that when into this demo. Creating demos for adventure games is hard, and more so for horror ones, where build-up and foreshadowing is so crucial. In a more action oriented game, the purpose is simply to show of the game's main mechanics (shooting, matching blocks, etc). However, in an adventure game, there is no such mechanic and it is the more holistic parts, like story, mood, etc, that shapes the experience.<br /><br />There are other problems besides showing off the game in the best possible way. It is also important to not have too many spoilers, so when starting the full game the player should not know too much. There is of course also the sale angle, you want people to be eager to buy after playing the demo.<br /><br />It was clear at once that we needed to start from the beginning of the game. The opening is crucial for understanding the game's story and putting the player in the right mood.  The problem is that our opening is quite long. Amnesia is not very action filled from the start and slowly builds up the mood. We felt that it needed to be shorter in the demo, so player could get a grasp of the game quicker. To fix this, we remade the first level a bit, so crucial items and information are found a bit earlier.  This shortens the experience, but contains the essence.<br /><br />Then it was the problem of what to show next. We wanted the demo to contain creature encounters, but as these are too slowly built up in the full game, they did not fit the demo. So after completing the first level, the player is transported about 2 hours into the game, where more stuff happens. It was then possible to let the demo go on from there and then end with a little cliffhanger. This also worked well from a spoiler viewpoint as the maps are more about atmosphere and most events have already been shown in videos.<br /><br />To further give the demo a good feel of the full game, we made the sanity mechanic be a bit more aggressive. This means that if will be easier to reach an insane state of mind than during normal play. The fear of going insane is a crucial element, so we felt we had to show it off somehow.<br /><br />I think the demo represent the full game fairly well and contains most of its major features. However, it is still in some sense a hacked-up version of the \"real thing\" and misses a lot of the atmospheric build-up.  There is also no time to show of up any of the story either (except for the initial setup), and we only focused on atmosphere for the demo. I guess this is just the way it is with demos and the same really goes for trailers and any sort of promotional material. The good thing is that if you enjoyed the demo you should like the full game even more!<br /><br />Hope you all enjoy this vertical slice of nightmare!

Keeping to the Amnesia tradition it is one single clip, showing a sequence from the game. This time it's about exploration and puzzle solving. It is the puzzle part that this blog post will discuss, as it took quite some time for us to get that puzzle right.<br /><br />The puzzle is that the hatch is too heavy to lift by hand, but by using a crank and pulley contraption the player can open it. Unfortunately something is wrong with the crank/pulley and the player has to figure out what it is. It turns out that a small  piece of wood has been jammed into one of the pulleys, making it impossible for the crank to pull the rope going through the pulley.<br /><br />This particular piece of wood took quite a lot of tweaking in order to make it noticeable. For each test session we found that there was always one or more testers that got stuck on this puzzle.

Keeping to the Amnesia tradition it is one single clip, showing a sequence from the game. This time it's about exploration and puzzle solving. It is the puzzle part that this blog post will discuss, as it took quite some time for us to get that puzzle right.<br /><br />The puzzle is that the hatch is too heavy to lift by hand, but by using a crank and pulley contraption the player can open it. Unfortunately something is wrong with the crank/pulley and the player has to figure out what it is. It turns out that a small  piece of wood has been jammed into one of the pulleys, making it impossible for the crank to pull the rope going through the pulley.<br /><br />This particular piece of wood took quite a lot of tweaking in order to make it noticeable. For each test session we found that there was always one or more testers that got stuck on this puzzle. They simply could not find what was wrong, most important, they did not notice the wooden piece at all. Over and over we tweaked the puzzle, we added descriptions and interaction messages, we changed the texture of the wooden piece, we added some faint light to show it clearer in the dark, there are some particles coming down from the wooden piece when you pull the crank, we made the model larger and we changed the angle it is stuck in.

So decided on giving it some kind of nice gold shader and started to experiment with this. We went through various versions, but it did not turn out that well. Unfortunately we could not have the gold shader as it was not visible enough in dark areas (something Amnesia is filled with) and we went with a more flat-shaded-thingie, that made it stand out more, instead.

There is so much done in games the past 20 years, based on cinema, that has kept videogames from evolving. Linear and strict plots being one of the biggest. Because movies rely so much on being extremely specific in what the viewer shall see, it has standards that are direct opposite of what a videogame is. By having these \"cinematic\" goals, we have gotten things like cut scenes where all the \"fun stuff\" happens, quick-time-events and annoying camera angles. Games would have been far better off if these things did not become the design standards they are today.<br /><br /><br /><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">2) Movies are not better</span><br />It implies that film is a superior medium. I would like to say that it is actually reverse. Film is probably the lesser of all story telling media. It leaves less to imagination and is the least fulfilling. Films do not require any real effort and leaves very little to the imagination. Sure, there are films that are hard to get and with very subtle imagery, but these are far between, and in my eyes does not live up the fantasies a great novel or piece of music can conjure up. In my mind games take all this a step further. While all other media gives us a prefabricated descriptions, videogames places us in living breathing worlds. I feel the difference is like reading about climbing Everest and actually doing it. Videogames as a medium is not inferior, I would say it is far superior than any else.<br /><br /><br />Does this means that the best games of today trump the best films, music and books? Far from it and quite the reverse. But videogames as a medium has an awesome potential. It would be very bad to let catchy buzz-words such as cinematic to stand in the way of fulfilling it.<div class=\"blogger-post-footer\"><img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/9193968969153274146-3253731995278668365?l=frictionalgames.blogspot.com' alt='' /></div>" "http://frictionalgames.blogspot.com/feeds/3253731995278668365/comments/default" (19578 48506) old 19 nil nil ((id nil "tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-9193968969153274146.post-3253731995278668365") (published nil "2010-08-29T19:04:00.005+02:00") (updated nil "2010-08-29T22:05:14.210+02:00") (title ((type .

My two major reasons for disliking the word are:<br /><br /><a onblur=\"try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}\" href=\"http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_QfesHslH-uc/THqXKUPS0QI/AAAAAAAAAM8/go4HP3ehkCM/s1600/_45483583_cinema512.jpg\"><img style=\"margin: 0px auto 10px; display: block; text-align: center; cursor: pointer; width: 320px; height: 180px;\" src=\"http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_QfesHslH-uc/THqXKUPS0QI/AAAAAAAAAM8/go4HP3ehkCM/s320/_45483583_cinema512.jpg\" alt=\"\" id=\"BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5510883297528566018\" border=\"0\" /></a><br /><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">1) Movies are not rolemodels</span><br />It means that videogames should strive to be more like cinema, that there are really important lessons to be learned by doing things like \"in the movies\". There is so much done in games the past 20 years, based on cinema, that has kept videogames from evolving. Linear and strict plots being one of the biggest. Because movies rely so much on being extremely specific in what the viewer shall see, it has standards that are direct opposite of what a videogame is. By having these \"cinematic\" goals, we have gotten things like cut scenes where all the \"fun stuff\" happens, quick-time-events and annoying camera angles. Games would have been far better off if these things did not become the design standards they are today.<br /><br /><br /><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">2) Movies are not better</span><br />It implies that film is a superior medium. I would like to say that it is actually reverse. Film is probably the lesser of all story telling media. It leaves less to imagination and is the least fulfilling. Films do not require any real effort and leaves very little to the imagination. Sure, there are films that are hard to get and with very subtle imagery, but these are far between, and in my eyes does not live up the fantasies a great novel or piece of music can conjure up. In my mind games take all this a step further. While all other media gives us a prefabricated descriptions, videogames places us in living breathing worlds. I feel the difference is like reading about climbing Everest and actually doing it. Videogames as a medium is not inferior, I would say it is far superior than any else.<br /><br /><br />Does this means that the best games of today trump the best films, music and books? Far from it and quite the reverse. But videogames as a medium has an awesome potential. It would be very bad to let catchy buzz-words such as cinematic to stand in the way of fulfilling it.<div class=\"blogger-post-footer\"><img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/9193968969153274146-3253731995278668365?l=frictionalgames.blogspot.com' alt='' /></div>") (link ((rel .
